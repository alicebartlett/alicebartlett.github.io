  <li>Did a little cry on Friday because I miss my old team and I feel like a bit of a loser that nobody wants to hang out with in my new job. Accidentally did this in front of the CTO who said some clever and kind things that put things in perspective for me. Well done JK.</li>
  <li>If youâ€™re reading this and you work with me, HELLO. Donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s fine to read this. Maybe you feel a bit like me admitting I cried on Friday was something you werenâ€™t supposed to read but actually, look, itâ€™s fine, I cry sometimes, I donâ€™t mind you knowing that. Normalise crying.</li>
  <li><a href="https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/10/22/1540184400000/Subprime-code--a-very-avoidable-crisis/">I find parts of this article a bit annoying but the phrase â€˜subprime code crisisâ€™ is good </a>.</li>
  <li>Someone has gone through our car? They didnâ€™t take anything because there wasnâ€™t anything to take. They just threw our old rail tickets everywhere.</li>
  <li>I went to the BreakfastOps thing on Tuesday and it was very good! Some interesting people said some interesting things, and the room they provided for me to pump in was great.</li>
  <li>A new game (that I learnt from <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/">Anna Shipman</a>, actually) is saying â€œOR SHEâ€ when people (usually men) say something like â€œWe donâ€™t know who the next CTO is, but heâ€™ll definitely care about Xâ€. Itâ€™s good because it doesnâ€™t derail the conversation and you can say it with a smile, or maybe a look of absolute boredom, depending on your personal brand.</li>
  <li>The real woke move would be to say â€œOR THEYâ€ but given these folks think there is currently only <em>one</em> gender applicable for technical people I think weâ€™re going to have to inch their Overton window a bit further before theyâ€™re ready to hear there might even be <em>more than two</em>.</li>
  <li>I finished my Ottoline jacket. I have written it up over on my <a href="http://sewing.butt.kitchen">sewing tumblr</a>. Jake Champion saw it on Friday and said â€œI like your jacket!â€ and then I got to say â€œThank you! I made it myselfâ€ which is always a nice feeling.</li>
  <li>I know I am being irrationally angry about this but I find the rhetoric used in cancer fund-raising eg â€œStand up to cancerâ€ extremely irritating. Cancer is an awful and complicated disease. Itâ€™s not the school bully who is going to leave us all alone if we â€œstand up to itâ€. Argh.</li>
