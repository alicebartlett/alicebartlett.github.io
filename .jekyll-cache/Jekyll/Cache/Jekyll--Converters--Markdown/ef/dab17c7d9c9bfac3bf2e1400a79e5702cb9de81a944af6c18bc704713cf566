  <li>This week I was reminded of the acronym from university: BNOC (pronounced be-nock). Big Name On Campus. In case it isn’t obvious, I was not a BNOC.</li>
  <li>C has a little goofy tooth and so has started biting me. It’s very unpleasant but avoidable if I really pay attention to him while feeding him.</li>
  <li>We’re selling our house. We’ve had 6 viewings in 3 days and it has been mad stressful keeping the place tidy and getting out of the house for the viewings. I will not be taking further questions at this time.</li>
  <li>Don’t know if this is a sign of the times or a sign of early onset dementia, but I have been really enjoying “Spin The Wheel”, a celebrity(!) gameshow(!) on Saturday night(!) presented by Michael Mcintyre(!!!).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ithoughtaboutthatalot.com/how-to-dispose-of-a-body">This piece about her mother dying</a> earlier this year by <a href="http://rebeccahales.co.uk/">Becky</a> is extremely tender and funny and wonderfully written.</li>
  <li>My 2.5 year old now comes with an 100% Lice Free Guarantee.</li>
  <li>I had a Keeping In Touch day on Monday. It was really good. Normally I’d have gone in for this and seen people face to face, but because of… <em>all this</em> I just popped up to the attic and did zoom calls. And occasionally a baby was brought to me for feeding.</li>
  <li>One of the things on the KIT day was some training and on the training the instructor said: You could be sitting looking at a piece of paper with a “9” on it, and I could be sat opposite and say “no that’s a 6” and we’d both be right because we just have different perspectives. I was struggling to keep a straight face to the extent that I nearly had to turn my camera off. Really makes u think.</li>
