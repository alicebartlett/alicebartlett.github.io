  <li>I listened to <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/podcasts/2019/07/17/mh17-episode-guide-1/">the Bellingcat podcast</a> about MH17 and it was good. There is something really familiar about the Bellingcat people - is that a weird thing to think? I feel like they‚Äôre from the same bit of the internet as me. Maybe I know someone who knows them.</li>
  <li>Denise shared <a href="https://thefractionatingcolumn.com/2014/10/21/thoughts-on-presenting/">this thing</a> from Nat from someone else about presenting. Even though I read Nat‚Äôs blog I had missed it. It was timely because I had just started writing a new talk. It contains lots of good references and links to other people, well worth a read.</li>
  <li>E had her first night away from both Lachie and me. I‚Äôm typing this right after she‚Äôs left with her Grandparents (7pm Sunday night) and I feel quite sick. I can hear Lachie in the bathroom cheerfully whistling ‚ÄúI had a little Turtle‚Äù which is presumably a coping mechanism.</li>
  <li>The mitten knittin‚Äô has finished. I just blocked them. I‚Äôve never blocked anything before.</li>
  <li>What is it that I find so excruciating about the Trivago adverts. There is nothing <em>obviously irritating</em> about them and yet they are highly annoying.</li>
  <li>Last weekend I got ID‚Äôd for buying firelighters in B&amp;Q. I think what happened was that the man that ID‚Äôd me was <em>very old</em> and from the distance with which he was observing me I seemed as young as an 18 year old in the same way that it‚Äôs difficult to judge the distance of two things that are both far away.</li>
  <li>Related: Did you know that the t-rex is closer in time to the iPod than it is to the stegosaurus? All the stegosauruses were already long long long dead when t-rex‚Äôs came along.</li>
  <li>The man did eventually sell me the firelighters.</li>
  <li><a href="http://yourcalendricalfallacyis.com/">I have tangoed with dates enough to appreciate this.</a> Did you know in the US and Australia they start the week on Sunday? SUNDAY?! Sunday is irrefutably part of the weekend. Week-end, week <em>end</em>.</li>
  <li>Last night I fell asleep on the sofa at 8:30.</li>
