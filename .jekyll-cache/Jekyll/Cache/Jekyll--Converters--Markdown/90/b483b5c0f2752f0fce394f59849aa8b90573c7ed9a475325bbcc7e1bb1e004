  <li>It’s Saturday night but anything I write now is going to seem utterly inconsequential by the time I post this as I WILL HAVE RETURNED TO WORK.</li>
  <li>We’re watching American Vandal 2 on Netflix. I like it although the scatological theme grosses me out a bit which is weird because I’m not usually grossed out by poo. There is <em>a lot</em> of poo in AV2 though so maybe I have found my threshold.</li>
  <li>[Alice vs Nature Update] We caught our 6th mouse.</li>
  <li>[Alice vs Nature Update] We have seen no more mice nor evidence of mice.</li>
  <li>[Apropos of something that happened a few weeks ago] Some people are vampires who will suck the fun out of anything.</li>
  <li>Doing a small cry about going back to work tomorrow because I’ve had such a lovely time on maternity leave. I had quite low expectations of how mat leave would be, because I like to prepare for the worst, but it was nowhere near as hard as I was expecting. Sometimes boring, sometimes frustrating but mostly a haze of cuddles and dribble and snot. Having a baby is as profound and mundane as everyone says it is.</li>

<h2 id="notes-from-going-back-to-work">Notes from going back to work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>They’re selling turmeric lattes in the canteen now. I haven’t tried one yet.</li>
  <li>My bike lock was still where I left it on the bike racks over a year ago.</li>
  <li>The logistics of expressing milk at work are quite challenging.</li>
  <li>The coffee bar woman welcomed me back! !! !</li>
  <li>CHEER UP TINY TEARS</li>
  <li>My work muscles have completely atrophied</li>
  <li>Today’s crying forecast is sobbing in the morning moving to distant looks, throat clearing and watery eyes in the afternoon.</li>
  <li>[Vignette of me trying to get access to the pumping room, the man with the key was on the bog every time I tried to find him] “TELL MARTIN HE NEEDS TO EAT MORE FIBRE!” / storms off.</li>
  <li>Why am I so sweaty all the time?</li>
  <li>There is too much stuff. I vaguely know about it already and yet it’s still too much</li>
  <li>People keep telling me things and I am having a hard time differentiating between “things that I need to know now, in my first week back” and “things that will be important later”. I recall being quite good at this kind of filtering before I left.</li>
  <li>I have made it to Friday. Pumping is still a nightmare.</li>
</ul>
