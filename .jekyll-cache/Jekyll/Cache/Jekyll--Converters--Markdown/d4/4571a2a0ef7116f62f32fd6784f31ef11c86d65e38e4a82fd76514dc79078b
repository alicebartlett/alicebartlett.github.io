  <li>Thanks for your email comments about my last weaknotes. When friends are encouraging about my #content it makes it seem like a good thing to be doing and not a weird misunderstanding in which I falsely consider myself interesting or worthy of your attention because I am a narcissist.</li>
  <li>Seriously how to I spell check in GitHubâ€™s text editor. <em>As if</em> I can spell narcissist correctly.</li>
  <li>When I go back to work in 4 weeks time Iâ€™m going to be doing a new job. Having taken nearly 10 months away it feels like a great opportunity to drop some not-so-great working habits and pick up some better ones. A bit like your first day back at school. <em>This is the year</em> I stop getting in trouble for talking in class.</li>
  <li>The good thing about weaknotes on my blog rather than Instagram stories is I get less of a sneaking suspicion some of you are actually hate-consuming my #content. When itâ€™s in the Insta feed you donâ€™t get a choice whereas this takes more effort to actually read. If youâ€™re still here, hate-reading, well thatâ€™s on you, Iâ€™m afraid.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™ve started playing Two Point Hospital (Theme Hospital 2018). Itâ€™s good, though a bit buggy. As you would expect, the copy is excellent. I laughed aloud at â€œCatches frisbee â€˜doggy styleâ€™â€ in particular. Steam is still a mess.</li>
  <li>If Lachie was a theme hospital character for hire, his hiring list would say
    <ul>
      <li>Gets a scottish accent when he talks to his mum</li>
      <li>Kind</li>
      <li>Squints a lot</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When I was about 8 my friends and I would always yell the same thing as we left each other on our divergent routes home: â€œBye everyone, and donâ€™t forget - todayâ€™s [weekday], tomorrowâ€™s [weekday] AND THE DAY AFTER THAT IS SATURDAY!â€. It didnâ€™t matter what day we were on, for some reason â€œTHE DAY AFTER THATâ€ was always â€œSATURDAYâ€. We thought this was extremely funny.</li>
  <li>This isnâ€™t interesting, but it is true.</li>
  <li>I think these weaknotes should have a title. The title of this one is â€œThe day after that is Saturdayâ€.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s back to school week in the UK. Please remember if you get the annual back-to-school cold, do us all a solid and STAY HOME. No heroics. You are not important enough to be needed in the office - the Lemsip adverts have been lying to you this whole time.</li>
  <li>The foxes have dug up my flowerbed for a second time. I cried genuine tiny tears as I replanted it in my pyjamas on Friday morning. Iâ€™m going to get some chicken wire, or GALVANISED STEEL TRIPLE TORSION MESH, as B&amp;Q call it, and cover the bed. Iâ€™ll also remove the delicious bonemeal that they have been eating. I will outfox these orange bastards.</li>
  <li>A man on Twitter has offered to make this site HTTPS for me. Thank you, gentle prince, but I must fight this battle alone or with the help of some googling. No, it is not as simple as checking a checkbox in the Github settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, love you all. Except those of you who are hate-reading. Itâ€™s fine. I also hate-read things. I SEE YOU. Rolling your eyes at me being soâ€¦ <em>me</em>. <em>UGH</em>. Love you bye.x</p>
