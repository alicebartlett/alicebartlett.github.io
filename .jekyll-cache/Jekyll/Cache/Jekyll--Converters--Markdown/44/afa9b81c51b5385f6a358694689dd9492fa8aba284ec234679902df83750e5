<p>BEEEEEEEEEES</p>

<p>For my good friend Helenâ€™s birthday I made her a shirt. Itâ€™s an Archer, of course. I donâ€™t have a picture of her wearing it, unfortunately. ALL I have are these three hastily snapped photos.</p>

<p>Helen chose the bee print while she was in London and I think it is SO CUTE. The fabric is from McCulloch and Wallis.</p>
