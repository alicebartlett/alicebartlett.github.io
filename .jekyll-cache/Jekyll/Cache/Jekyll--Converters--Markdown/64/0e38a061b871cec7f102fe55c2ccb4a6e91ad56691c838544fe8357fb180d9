  <li>Hello everyone. I am feeling a little unsettled this week. I think itâ€™s because we moved office, but Iâ€™ve just not been able get into anything at work. Everything I did just felt like skating over the surface of a problem not properly understanding it and not properly dealing with it. Hopefully next week will be better.</li>
  <li>Relatedly I am deep <em>deep</em> into not knowing what is going on with our tech stack.</li>
  <li>The new office is really nice. They have fizzy water on tap, and Japanese toilets that spritz your bum if you want. Now, when I feel like indulging I can go for a â€œluxury pooâ€.</li>
  <li>Feeling very much like the sort of person that responds to adverts that begin â€œLife got you down?â€</li>
  <li>I read this <a href="https://tinyletter.com/waysofeating/letters/i-dream-of-canteens">article about canteens</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/aanand">@aanand</a> shared via twitter. Itâ€™s great and really captures why I like the Sainsburyâ€™s cafÃ© so much. The Sainsburyâ€™s cafÃ© isnâ€™t technically a canteen (and youâ€™re not allowed to eat your own food there, although the staff donâ€™t seem to mind if you do) but even on a Saturday lunchtime there is enough space to feel no pressure to move along, and thereâ€™s plenty of different types of seating, and lots of people enjoying a lunch out. I once saw a man throw up on the floor and nobody made a big deal out of it.</li>
  <li>I made another Kalle shirt. Iâ€™m going to make a third.</li>
