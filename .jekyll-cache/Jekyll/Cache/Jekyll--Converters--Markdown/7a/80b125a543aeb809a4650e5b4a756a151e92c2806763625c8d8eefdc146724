  <li>Some things I learnt at work this week:
    <ol>
      <li>In a study about hydration, people who were properly hydrated performed 14% better at cognitive tasks than people who were not properly hydrated.</li>
      <li>In a mass productivity study the most productive people were those who averaged 52 minutes uninterrupted work and 17 minutes break.</li>
      <li>Itâ€™s a good idea to count to seven in your head after you have said â€œis everyone happy to move on?â€ if chairing a meeting in order to give anyone with introverted preferences time to think and then speak.</li>
      <li>â€œJamesâ€™â€ is the US English way to do singular possessive proper nouns. â€œJamesâ€™sâ€ is British.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>One of the things I did at work this week was cry in some training. I donâ€™t normally feel particularly embarrassed about crying but this was mortifying. It was in front of three strangers and a man named Rob. Having never seen three of the people in that room before in my life, of course, now I see them everywhere.</li>
  <li>I canâ€™t watch that new David Attenborough thing. I get too sad.</li>
  <li>I spent the whole day sewing and now my fingers hurt.</li>
</ul>
