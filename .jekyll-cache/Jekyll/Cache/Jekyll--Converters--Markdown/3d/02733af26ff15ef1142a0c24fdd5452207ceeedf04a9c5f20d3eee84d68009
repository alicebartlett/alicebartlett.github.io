I"<p>Waaaaay back in October 2015, <a href="https://twitter.com/evilstreak">Dom</a> and I gave a talk at the London Ruby User Group about fixing a performance issue in the Ruby Mustache Gem.</p>

<p>This came about because <a href="https://twitter.com/hlame">Murray</a>, who runs LRUG saw a blog post I’d written about the issue and asked me to talk about it. At the time I said “sure, but Dom should do it too” and cc’d him in to the email chain, not knowing that Dom had never done a talk before and I had just signed him up to his first without asking. Whoops!</p>

<p>The slides are here <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/evilstreak/fixing-a-performance-issue-with-the-mustache-gem">on Speakerdeck</a></p>

<p>The blog post (which I’m v proud of) is here: <a href="https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/06/09/major-performance-issue-with-mustache-and-partials/">on the GDS techblog</a></p>

<p>There’s a video of it here <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6598-debugging-and-fixing-performance-issues-with-the-mustache-gem-and-partials">on the skills matter website</a></p>

<p>Two things I want to commit to blog about this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Murray is a brilliant steward of the London Ruby community, and he’s been doing it for flipping ages. He should probably get a CBE or something. He’s probably so classy he’d turn it down.</li>
  <li>It was enormous fun getting to give this talk with Dom. I mostly give talks on my own, and Dom mostly doesn’t give talks at all, so it was really ace to do an LRUG together.</li>
</ol>
