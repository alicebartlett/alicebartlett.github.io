I"Ö<p><em>[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I‚Äôve moved over from my Tumblr. I‚Äôve just copied the words and pictures across.</em></p>

<p>Good question <a href="https://natbuckley.com">@ntlk!</a></p>

<p>I generally follow women whose style I like and who only post things they‚Äôve sewn rather than lots of other stuff too. I also tend to follow people in the same hemisphere so that everyone is sewing through the same seasons as me. Here is a list.</p>

<p>http://honig-design.blogspot.co.uk/ : I started following honig design after <a href="http://www.honigdesign.com/2015/07/triangles.html#.XFIRM8_7RjV">this incredible dress she made</a>. This is how I would dress if I wasn‚Äôt such a disastrous slob.</p>

<p>http://thegirlwhomakesthings.blogspot.co.uk/: I started following this blog after seeing this <a href="http://thegirlwhomakesthings.blogspot.com/2015/04/holly-jumpsuit.html">very well fitting romper</a>.</p>

<p>http://www.randomlyhappyblog.com/: <a href="http://www.randomlyhappyblog.com/how-to-sew-the-ultimate-relaxed-trousers/">This post</a> about trousers was the reason I found them</p>

<p>http://reanalouise.blogspot.co.uk/: When I found this jacket I was like <a href="http://reanalouise.blogspot.com/2015/05/false-advertising.html">oh shit this girl is for me</a>.</p>

<p>http://www.hyerhandmade.com/blog/: When you sew your own stuff, everything can get a bit twee. Hyer is notable because she is definitely not sewing twee doily bullshit, and also she takes absolutely lovely photos of the stuff she‚Äôs sewn.</p>

<p>http://whatkatiesews.net/: I know this is weird but I sort of feel from her writing that Katie and me would get on famously if we ever met. She is a prolific sew-er and she makes a lot of stuff that I would like to wear. Good taste.</p>

<p>http://www.guthrie-ghani.co.uk/blog: These folks are actually a shop in Birmingham, but they have a really great blog which they post nicely sewn up versions of some of their patterns.</p>

<p>https://joliesbobines.wordpress.com/: Jolies Bobines is a French blogger who posts in both French and English. She has impeccable effortless french style is really good at sewing too.</p>

<p>http://grainlinestudio.com/: This is the blog Jen and Kendra from Grainline write. It has some very good practical tutorials as well as posts about making their patterns (of which I am a great fan)</p>

<p>http://gingermakes.com/: Ginger is really good at sewing and really good at writing. She also comes across as a really nice person, so I‚Äôm always pleased when she has something new to share.</p>

<p>http://diy-couture.blogspot.co.uk/ Is from London I think. She has a wicked style (lots of bright colours, streetwear-y etc).</p>

<p>http://closetcasefiles.com/ is an indie pattern creator as well as a prolific sewist. She does lots of very handy round-ups of what other people are sewing in her weekly <a href="https://closetcasepatterns.com/this-week-in-sewing-blogs-vol-69/">‚Äúthis week in sewing‚Äù</a> posts, and through her I‚Äôve found a lot of other people to follow.</p>

<p>http://www.adaspragg.com/ is a real legit babe. She sews a lot of really lovely stuff and it‚Äôs always beautifully photographed too.</p>

<p>https://sewstylist.wordpress.com/: doesn‚Äôt post all that often, but she has an undeniable style. <a href="https://sewstylist.wordpress.com/2014/09/05/experiments-in-outwear/">Look at this outfit! Look at it!!!</a></p>

<p>And that‚Äôs it!</p>
