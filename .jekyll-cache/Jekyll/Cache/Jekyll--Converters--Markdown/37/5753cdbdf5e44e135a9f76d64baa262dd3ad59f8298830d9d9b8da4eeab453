I"<p>Dan Williams <a href="http://www.iamdanw.com/wrote/yearnote-2014/">had an incredible 2014</a> and, reading his, I was (1) massively impressed and (2) inspired to do my own. I’ve stolen his format and everything.</p>

<p>2014 was the year I became a <a href="#work">front-end developer at the Government Digital Service</a>. I set up this <a href="#bloggering">blog</a>. I started <a href="#tampon-club">Tampon Club</a>, and 2 new <a href="#tumblrs">Tumblrs</a>. I took a really good <a href="#holiday">holiday</a>. I did a bit of <a href="#public-speaking">public speaking</a> and I was on <a href="#and-finally">telly</a>.</p>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>I joined GDS in January. It’s going pretty good. Since joining I’ve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>made about 700 contributions to government repositories</li>
  <li>started line managing juniors</li>
  <li>co-run weekly frontend meetings for GDS frontend developers</li>
  <li>MC’d the GDS Christmas all-hands</li>
  <li>written a <a href="https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/08/14/improving-accessibility-on-gov-uk-search/">blog post for the GDS tech blog</a> about accessibility on GOV.UK</li>
  <li>Helped interview developers for three different sets of developer interviews</li>
  <li>started mentoring a colleague</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-ive-failed-at">Things I’ve failed at</h3>
<p>I have to write this here because that list makes me sound like I’m kind of full of myself. I definitely did fuck some stuff up this year too. I made a list of cockups and looking at them the general theme is giving up too soon on things/people/opportunities when stuff became hard or I got too busy. I should probably say yes to fewer things. The other bad thing I did this year was type a password into a public channel by accident <em>twice</em>. Both times this was swiftly resolved, but gosh, it’s embarrassing when that happens.</p>

<h2 id="bloggering">Bloggering</h2>
<p>This year I started a blog. You’re reading it. I built it myself and it’s… fine? Laughably simple, but you can see all these words so I guess it works. The good thing about blogs is that when you have one you can write stuff without needing to set up a blog first. The bad thing about blogs is that the you end up with a drafts folder full of things you gave up on because they turned out to be hard to explain. Here are the titles of my unpublished folder right now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accessibility <em>-this is a post about how accessibility is sort of like a cake</em></li>
  <li>Select tags writeup <em>-this is a post of a writeup of a talk. Its really long</em></li>
  <li>Tampon club for dudes <em>-this is a post about what to do if you’re a dude and you care about Tampon Club</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, two of those will get published one day. One probably won’t.</p>

<h2 id="tampon-club">Tampon Club</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tampon_club_new.jpg" alt="Tampon Club stickers" /></p>

<p>Another thing I did this year was founding Tampon Club. It has a <a href="http://tampon.club">website</a>. People have written things about it:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.howwegettonext.com/Article/VIB86CsAACcA2lFf/tampon-club-no-apologies-for-menstruation-based-innovation#.VKwd6WSsV8s">www.howwegettonext.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.vice.com/read/meet-the-woman-who-wants-you-to-fill-your-office-bogs-with-free-tampons-873">Vice</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I was also asked onto BBC Radio 5 Live’s breakfast show to talk about it. The audio for that is <a href="http://butt.kitchen/post/104591582049/i-went-on-bbc-radio-5-lives-breakfast-show-this">here on my Tumblr.</a></p>

<h2 id="tumblrs">Tumblrs</h2>
<p>I started two new tumblrs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one for my nail art <a href="http://nails.butt.kitchen">nails.butt.kitchen</a></li>
  <li>one for my sewing <a href="http://sewing.butt.kitchen">sewing.butt.kitchen</a>. I sewed 14 things this year; 2 kindle cases, 6 shirts, 3 t-shirts one shirt-dress, one vest, and one quilt. I also abandoned 1 dress, 1 vest, 1 shirt, 1 playsuit and one shirt-dress because I screwed them up beyond repair :(</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="holiday">Holiday</h2>
<p>I went on a cracking holiday with Lachie. We did an american road trip from Denver to Vegas.</p>

<p>It was beautiful!</p>

<h2 id="public-speaking">Public speaking</h2>
<p>I gave three talks this year and was on one panel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Five facts about smell- the lightning talk at LRUG -<a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5050-five-facts-about-smell">Video</a></li>
  <li>Edge 3- the future of the web -<a href="https://edgeconf.com/2014-london?v=6u03xYkwMVI">Video</a></li>
  <li>Dump your <select><option>select</option></select> tags - Nightly Build in Cologne</li>
  <li>Dump your <select><option>select</option></select> tags - Epic FEL. -<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUkMCQR4TpY">Video</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="and-finally">And finally</h2>
<p>I was on the Alan Titchmarsh TV show back in February for a feature about nail art. I took a colleague on with me, Amy, and we had a reeeeally fun time. Live telly is quite good. Here is the video. I’m clearly petrified.</p>
