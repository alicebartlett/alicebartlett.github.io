<p>Fabric: Liberty â€œManningâ€ bought from Raystitch (<a href="http://www.raystitch.co.uk/fabric/lighter-weight-fabrics-lawn-and-voile/liberty-tana-lawn-6.html">http://www.raystitch.co.uk/fabric/lighter-weight-fabrics-lawn-and-voile/liberty-tana-lawn-6.html</a>) Iâ€™m madly in love with this fabric.</p>

<p>Pattern: <a href="http://shop.grainlinestudio.com/product/scout-woven-tee">http://shop.grainlinestudio.com/product/scout-woven-tee</a>. Lengthened this by 1 inch and Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s the perfect length for me. I also lengthened the sleeves by about an inch, and I prefer them to the pattern length which always seem a little short.</p>
