I"¼<p>For my 30th birthday I decided to learn how to knit. I did some knitting, a jumper for E, which turned out OK if a bit wonky, and a jumper for me which turned out bad. Then I stopped knitting for a bit. These mittens are the first new thing Iâ€™ve made since then. I used Wool And The Gangâ€™s sugar baby alpaca wool.</p>

<p>I made the pattern up using parts from Mary Scott Huffâ€™s book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34227579-the-mitten-handbook">â€œThe Mitten Handbookâ€</a>.</p>

<p>Mitten knitting is great - lots of opportunity to customise different aspects, plenty of new techniques, quick to finish. Obviously mittens are very chic too. I also have very big hands, so itâ€™s thrilling to be able to knit something big enough to accommodate them.</p>

<p>Some technical details for next time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Nordic cast on</li>
  <li>50 sts twisted rib</li>
  <li>Increase to 60 sts</li>
  <li>4 sts stockinette</li>
  <li>western gusset thumb until 21 sts</li>
  <li>60 rows stockinette (? I actually canâ€™t remember if this is right and Iâ€™m too lazy to count. Future me - you may want to count!)</li>
</ol>
