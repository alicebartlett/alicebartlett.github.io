I"f<p><em>[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I’ve moved over from my Tumblr. I’ve just copied the words and pictures across.</em></p>

<p>This tumblr wasn’t dead, it was just sleeping.</p>

<p>I had a baby back in January and while that was happening there didn’t seem to be much point sewing clothes for myself as my body was changing shape and I wasn’t sure how it was going to shake out.</p>

<p>Anyway. Things have settled down sufficiently for me to be able to make a jacket with the confidence that it will fit for a while. This is the <a href="https://merchantandmills.com/store/patterns/the-ottoline/">Ottoline</a> from Merchant and Mills. I made it in their <a href="https://merchantandmills.com/store/cloth/best-navy-twill/">“Best Navy Twill”</a>. It sewed up really quickly and had some nice touches (the side vents in particular were fun to sew and had clear instructions). Sometimes M&amp;M patterns seem to run large, but this is a 12 and it fits me fine.</p>
