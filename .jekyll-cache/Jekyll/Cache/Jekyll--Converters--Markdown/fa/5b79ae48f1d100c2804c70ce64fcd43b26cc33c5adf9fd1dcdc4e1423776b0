I"¥<p><em>[Note] Hello - this is an old post that Iâ€™ve moved over from my Tumblr. Iâ€™ve just copied the words and pictures across.</em></p>

<p>A coat for a baby! Itâ€™s the <a href="https://www.burdastyle.com/pattern_store/patterns/quilted-baby-coat-092013">Quilted Baby Coat from BurdaStyle</a>. Iâ€™m really so proud of how this coat turned out. Itâ€™s beautiful!</p>

<p>I made it using some Kokka Painted Canvas from the offcuts bin in Cloth House. It (and some other colour-ways too) are still available from <a href="https://raystitch.co.uk/products/fabric/japanese-fabrics">Ray Stitch</a>.</p>

<p>The adorable bunny lining is also from Cloth House, you can buy it online here from <a href="https://www.macculloch-wallis.co.uk/p/21092/quilting-prints/mw/japanese-rabbits">Macculoch &amp; Wallis</a>.</p>

<p>For the sleeves I used some soft brushed cotton from <a href="https://raystitch.co.uk">Ray Stitch</a>.</p>

<p>The pattern was very straightforward. The only changes I made were switching out the buttons for poppers, and using a woven fabric rather than a knitted fabric.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll be making more of these in the future.</p>
