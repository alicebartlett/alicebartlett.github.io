I"…<p><em>[Note] Hello - this is an old post that Iâ€™ve moved over from my Tumblr. Iâ€™ve just copied the words and pictures across.</em></p>

<p>I married my long-time boyfriend (and sewing.butt.kitchen photographer) yesterday. We didnâ€™t tell anyone until the day after we did it, except for our four guests. It was a perfect Saturday, followed by an equally wonderful Sunday of telling all our friends and family that we got married without telling them!</p>

<p>For a dress I wanted something I might be able to wear again, that was special but not so special that it would look weird if we went to the pub after the ceremony.</p>

<p>This fabric is Katey Stretch Beige from Fabric Godmother. When I saw it I knew is was the right thing for the job. Itâ€™s so lovely. I have loads left over, so I expect there will be matching trousers.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a Merchant and Mills Camber in size 14, which was enormous! I made a muslin which helped me figure out I had to take a lot in at the sides. What I didnâ€™t manage to figure out was that the neck was too big at the front, just gaping away from me. To correct that I had to unpick the shoulder seams and then re-sew it all (mostly by hand)</p>

<p>I love the camber neck-line so much but it doesnâ€™t work for me without alteration. I really really have to remember that for next time.</p>

<p>Anyway! There we go, a wedding dress.</p>
