I"‰<p><em>[Note] Hello - this is an old post that Iâ€™ve moved over from my Tumblr. Iâ€™ve just copied the words and pictures across.</em></p>

<p>A really long time ago I won a competition that <a href="http://www.hannahinthehouse.com">http://www.hannahinthehouse.com</a> was running, and the prize was some fabric from Liberty.</p>

<p>Wellâ€¦ itâ€™s been about 6 months but I have FINALLY made something worth showing with that fabric.</p>

<p>When I was making a Kindle case for my mum, I knew this grey and green and blue ditzy floral would be perfect for the lining.</p>

<p>The exterior is made from old quilting scraps from a quilt I still havenâ€™t finished in spite of starting it about a year ago (isnâ€™t that always the way with quilts).</p>

<p>Iâ€™m so pleased with the end result. Thank you Hannah and Liberty for the fabric!</p>
