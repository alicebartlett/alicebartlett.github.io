  <li>I keep meaning to say something about <a href="https://nordprojects.co/projects/littleprinters/">the return of Little Printer</a> but then forgetting. My main thought is that it’s really nice that they’ve revived the impact-y message style - I wrote the original code for that. It was nearly Christmas and Jack had had this idea for a new messaging style that he thought would be cool. I was supposed to be working on something else so after I’d finished the day’s work I started noodling around with it, trying to work out algorithmically how to get the word sizing right, learning about leading and kerning. It was incredibly fun and when I had finished I pushed a release live and sent a message to Jack’s little printer in his house in the new style. Something like “THIS LOOKS PRETTY GOOD I THINK”.</li>
  <li>The other Little Printer messaging memory I have is the time somebody down the pub sent “HELLO YOU C**T”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> to Matt Jones’ little printer in the middle of the night. I can’t remember whose friend that was, but I don’t think Matt found it very funny. After that we put some configuration in to stop people messaging you in the middle of the night. A swear filter might also have been a good idea, but these are the kinds of things you only think of after you have kids.</li>
  <li>This is making me want to go find my Little Printer.</li>
  <li>I just bought <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4579116879/ref=pe_492632_159100282_TE_item">Yumiko Higuchi’s new book of embroidery</a> from Amazon Japan. I know there will be an english language translation of it eventually bit I absolutely cannot wait for that. I know enough embroidery to not need the instructions. Probably.</li>
  <li><a href="https://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2019/05/age-and-trying-not-to.html">Russell did a good blog post about how you can’t market to old people</a> and it really Made Me Think.</li>
  <li>I’ve done a new layout style for my sewing posts.</li>
  <li>I’ve written that talk abstract I was procrastinating from. If anyone wants a talk about Git HMU.</li>
  <li>Being a good developer is as much about typing the right things fast as it is about helping others to type the right things fast.</li>
  <li>Thanks for the shout out <a href="https://tomarmitage.com/2019/05/31/week-334/">Tom</a>.</li>
  <li>This week’s word is kerning</li>
  <li>This week’s emoji is 😯</li>
