  <li>Weaknotes twenty!</li>
  <li>Edith turned one year old this week. Iâ€™m considering getting a second opinion on that though, because there is no way sheâ€™s one. I canâ€™t accept it.</li>
  <li>I started sewing a <a href="https://merchantandmills.com/store/patterns/the-tn31-parka/">Fern Green TN31 Parka from M&amp;M</a> this weekend. I realised recently that all the coats Iâ€™ve ever made have been navy blue, this is an exciting departure!</li>
  <li>Edith started nursery this week, although she got a fever on Thursday so they sent her home. I had to look after her on Thursday and Friday which was pretty rough to be honest! Other than the sickness she has taken to nursery OK. Not too many tears.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m phoning in weaknotes this week because itâ€™s Sunday night and I have some other things to do before I go to bed.</li>
  <li>I listened to the first episode of this <a href="https://www.originsthepodcast.com/">Origins podcast about Sex and The City</a>. It was good. I have complicated feelings about SATC. Iâ€™ve seen every episode multiple times but if you were to say to me â€œAlice, Sex and The City is rubbishâ€ Iâ€™d say â€œyouâ€™re not wrongâ€.</li>
  <li>Thatâ€™s it Byeeeeeeeeee</li>
