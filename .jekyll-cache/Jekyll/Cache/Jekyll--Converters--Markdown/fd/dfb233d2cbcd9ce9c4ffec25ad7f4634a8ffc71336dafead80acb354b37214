  <li>Vegan cornettos are good arenâ€™t they. As good as normal cornettos.</li>
  <li>There is some training at the FT for line managers and it includes the line â€œPeople donâ€™t leave bad jobs, they leave bad managersâ€. Which is concise and sounds like itâ€™s true.</li>
  <li>Of the 4 people I line manage, 3 of them have resigned or switched teams in the last month.</li>
  <li>At work everybody is getting a small photo frame to put whatever they want in to jazz the place up a bit (our new office is very grey - I donâ€™t mind it at all but it makes some people feel sad). The CTO has put a photo of his pug in his one. His pug is a bonk-eyed snaggle-toothed hairball, utterly utterly hideous. Like - you have never seen a dog this ugly. Anyway. What will I put in my frame? Obviously E is the thing that cheers me up the most, but I donâ€™t want to subject her to the judgement of the office. She is too good for the office. Someone asked me if I felt any pressure to be â€œwittyâ€ with what I put in my frame. The answer to that is no. It had occurred to me that this is an opportunity to do a joke but I havenâ€™t thought of anything funny yet. Well, actually Iâ€™ve thought of some funny things (â€œShut up and do some typingâ€, â€œWe arenâ€™t paying you to chit-chatâ€) but all of them would probably not be as funny to everyone else as I find them. Current best plan is some pressed flowers from the garden and maybe Iâ€™ll write â€œcheer up tiny tearsâ€ really small. ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¼</li>
  <li>There are currently five - <em>five</em> - active toilet rolls in our upstairs toilet. It is a mystery how this has happened.</li>
  <li>Eâ€™s (Scottish) grandparents have mounted an attack on her accent and as such she now says â€œpearâ€ and â€œbearâ€ with a Scottish accent <em>but nothing else</em>. They may have won the battle but they have lost the war.</li>
  <li>Me and the fam went to Green Man this weekend. Predictably, E loved it. They have a whole sub-festival for kids called â€œLittle Folkâ€ which has live music, craft, water kitchens, ball pools, weird installations. I usually find festivals a bit stressful - I donâ€™t like crowds of people at all and while Iâ€™ve sort of got a grip on my fear of glitter, people at festivals seem to cover themselves in it and I feel genuine revulsion looking at them. I normally put up with this because I like camping, I like being outside, and I like live music, but itâ€™s a different balance of activities when you have an 18 month old to take care of.</li>
