I"X<p>Following on from the mittens I made for myself, I made some for E. It remains to be seen how much she’ll wear them but so far she is a big fan of taking them on and off.</p>

<p>Once again, I made the pattern up using parts from Mary Scott Huff’s book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34227579-the-mitten-handbook">“The Mitten Handbook”</a>.</p>

<p>Rather than following a pattern I just traced around E’s hand and knitted something accordingly.</p>
