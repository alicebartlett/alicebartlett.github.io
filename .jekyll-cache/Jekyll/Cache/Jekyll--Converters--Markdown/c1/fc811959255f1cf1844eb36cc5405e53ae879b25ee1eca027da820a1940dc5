  <li><a href="https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/everything-you-know-about-obesity-is-wrong/">It’s 2am, I just read this about obesity</a>. Lots of interesting facts about how public health issues take a ridiculously long time to get fixed even after the cure is discovered (scurvy, seatbelts). Also many, <em>many</em>, horrific stories about how fat people are treated.</li>
  <li>Oh man I agreed to share my “one weird tip” for web developers in a video Google are making. My “weird tip” is neither weird or really a tip? Sorry everyone.</li>
  <li>I did that Google video thing and it was fun! It was interesting trying to answer their questions in 30 second soundbites. I think having to condense my answers down so much is going to make me seem a bit dim but I guess I can live with that.</li>
  <li>[Alice vs Nature update] Had to happen eventually, I stood on a mouse trap.</li>
  <li>[Alice vs Nature update] We caught a mouse!</li>
  <li>[Alice vs Nature update] I’ve already seen another mouse.</li>
  <li>Edith has a cold.</li>
  <li>This is a good video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSEU7ivOnzc">Paul Lewis about RequestAnimationFrame</a>. Paul’s done a few of these and his attention to detail in them is actually quite sickening. I find it a bit obnoxious of Paul to make videos this good when it’s not even his main job.

  <li>[Alice loves Nature update] The trees in Mayow Park are so breathtaking at the moment. I keep taking photos of them but they all just look like photos of trees?</li>
  <li>Edith had another swimming lesson and the teacher thought she was a boy again despite me casually dropping her pronoun after introducing her.</li>
  <li>This looks like a very thorough breakdown of <a href="https://medium.com/welldone-software/an-overview-of-javascript-testing-in-2018-f68950900bc3">JS testing in 2018</a>. I haven’t read it (yet) but “what testing framework is best” is the perennial No. 1 bike shedding topic for developers so I’m sure this article will be useful soon.</li>
