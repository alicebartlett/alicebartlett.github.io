  <li>Hello my babies.</li>
  <li>It’s ONE WHOLE YEAR since I went back to work after maternity leave. <a href="https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-7">Here is what I said about it</a>.</li>
  <li>Google Hangouts now have live captioning turned if you want it but they asterisk out any swearing?! This seems absurd to me - what are you protecting me from? The knowledge that my colleague described something as “shit”? Not really! Because when I see “s***” I know what they said was “shit”!</li>
  <li>Possibly they have ported auto captioning tech that they use on YouTube, where maybe protecting people from swears is deemed more important.</li>
  <li>I’m on the fence about how offensive swearing is - some people hate it - some people (hello, mum) enjoy dropping a strategic F-bomb. The thing I find really annoying is the asterisk-ing out. If you’re going to swear, actually do it?</li>
  <li>I noticed this because Google mis-interpreted something my colleague said as “shit” when they didn’t even say that. It was an <em>imagined</em> swear.</li>
  <li>My bike fell on my leg on Tuesday. It landed on my thigh gears first and then scraped down to mid calf. I have some very aesthetic bruises coming through and some nice scrape marks.</li>
  <li>Did you know there isn’t a washing machine emoji. I guess that’s indicative of how unimportant people think domestic work is. I asked some insiders about this and they showed me <a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/emoji-requests.html">this page of all emoji requests made to the Emoji Subcommittee</a>. It has “washing machine” on it with the status “Added to larger set” which probably means it’s being rolled up into a group of emojis (like domestic appliances) to be added.</li>
  <li>My secret source also told me that because of the push to get better skin tone representation (eg two different coloured hands shaking hands 🤝) into emoji, there is not a lot of time for adding other new things. Which is fine. I don’t need a washing machine emoji <em>that badly</em> my washing machine is fixed now anyway.</li>
  <li>Did you see the request for a vulva emoji in that list? I think I’ll stick with the taco thanks 🌮, especially <em>especially</em> if it means we don’t have to have a penis emoji.</li>
  <li>The man who fixed my washing machine, in contrast to last week’s man, called me “sweetie”, “madam”, and “my love” a lot, and asked if the drill out on the table “belonged to my husband”.</li>
  <li>Yes the drill belongs to my husband. No you shut up. I could use a drill if I wanted to I just choose not to.</li>
  <li>Today we went to Dulwich Pavilion. I did it mainly for instagram but E actually really enjoyed running around it like a little maniac.</li>
  <li>I’ve been able to have short conversations with E for a while now. It’s lovely.</li>
