  <li>There is a diet coke ad I get a lot when watching Community on All4. Everyone on the internet <a href="http://adturds.co.uk/2018/11/13/diet-coke-mango-advert-superbad-superannoying-superstupid/">absolutely hates this advert</a> (<a href="https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/turkey-week-diet-cokes-joyless-because-i-can-ad-doesnt-feel-good/1460587">and the others in the series</a>) but I completely love it. Obviously Diet Coke tastes disgusting, but this guy doesnâ€™t care! He likes it! â€œYouâ€™ve just got to like what you likeâ€ he tells me. Thank you Diet Coke man, I will!</li>
  <li>Edith can say â€œherroâ€ now, though more often she just waves. She will also (sometimes) put her hands above her head if you say â€œreach for the skyyyyâ€ which is absurdly cute.</li>
  <li>The canteen only had smooth peanut butter or â€œpeanut freeâ€ peanut butter on Tuesday morning. Not sure why youâ€™d want to eat peanut free peanut butter. Maybe if you had a peanut allergy but then itâ€™s right next to the peanut butter in the canteen and someone might have stuck a peanutty knife into it, so would you risk it?</li>
  <li>I still really like being back at work. When dudes used to tell me â€œmy wife doesnâ€™t work but oh boy is looking after a child a full time job!!!â€ I found it kind of phoney and insincere but having properly done both I can tell you that, for me, looking after a child is significantly harder than going to work every day. That probably has to do with my job in part. Iâ€™m really pleased weâ€™re doing shared parental leave so Lachie can do full time baby wrangling.</li>
  <li>Edith has another cold, and can only sleep if Iâ€™m holding her otherwise she coughs and wakes herself up. I did kind of have plans for this naptime such as publishing my weaknotes but instead Iâ€™m in a gloomy room slowly losing feeling in my arm.</li>
  <li>I tweeted about this once I think, but it came up again this week. Iâ€™ve invented a measure for how similar two people look. The â€œBartlett Numberâ€ of two individuals is the lowest age of a child that can draw a picture of the two individuals such that itâ€™s obvious which person in the picture is which.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m sewing another <a href="https://grainlinestudio.com/shop/women/tamarack-jacket-pdf/">Tamarack</a>. It will be my third <a href="http://sewing.butt.kitchen/post/133426538028/grainline-tamarack-jacket">1</a>,<a href="http://sewing.butt.kitchen/post/154044565363/tamarack-2">2</a>.</li>
