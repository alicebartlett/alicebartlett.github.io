  <li>Hullo.</li>
  <li>Weâ€™re going to pop in a cheeky two week isolation before Christmas so we can spend the Christmas week with my in-laws, shaking the shit out of each otherâ€™s hands, shouting in unventilated spaces until weâ€™re hoarse and breathing in each otherâ€™s mouths with gay abandon. Just like baby Jesus would have wanted.</li>
  <li>This is possible because Iâ€™m on maternity leave anyway so taking my two year old out of nursery is erâ€¦ easy peasy.</li>
  <li>Speaking of nursery. Eâ€™s head has become the home to a single mother and about 20 children again because <em>somebody at nursery</em> did not delouse themselves thoroughly enough.</li>
  <li>I know what youâ€™re thinking - just use the shampoo? No my dudes - the shampoo doesnâ€™t work on the eggs! I swear it used to? Like when we were little? Anyway - those were the good old days before smothering our childrenâ€™s heads in pesticides was considered a bit reckless.</li>
  <li>We went to Southend-on-sea today and it was amazing. I ate some fresh hot doughnuts. They were amazing. Hot, pillowy, sugary, perfect.</li>
  <li>Back in February E came home with a card that said â€œMummy, I love you from the bottom of my heart to the tips of my toesâ€ with a heart made by her footprints. Sweet, you think, but hang on a second - the bottom of her heart to the tips of her toes? Thatâ€™s like, 2/3rds of her at best? and most of that is either bowels or legs? THINK IT THROUGH PEOPLE. I still think about it.</li>
