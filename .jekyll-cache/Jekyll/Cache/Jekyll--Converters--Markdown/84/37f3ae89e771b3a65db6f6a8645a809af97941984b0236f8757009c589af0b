I"<p><em>[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I’ve moved over from my Tumblr. I’ve just copied the words and pictures across.</em></p>

<p>I made a mobile for my daughter.</p>

<p>I thought I might have made a bit of an error by making a boring and tasteful mobile which she would hate but actually she loves it and loves lying underneath it watching the fishes swim around.</p>

<p>The pattern is Yumiko Higuchi’s fish from her book Zakka Embroidery.</p>
