  <li>Stressful week. Trying to remember to drink enough water.</li>
  <li>Drinking water, like brushing my teeth very throughly, it is something that calms me down because it is good for me and it doesnâ€™t rub up against any of my ongoing low-level worries - the environment, my health and money. But also, every cell of my human-baby-son must pass through my body first. This chonky boy drinks a lot of milk so I have to produce a lot. Water is the main component of breast milk so Iâ€™ve got to drink enough for two.</li>
  <li>Also did you know that production of breastmilk has been shown to leech calcium from a motherâ€™s bones, if they were not consuming enough. Thatâ€™s how serious my body is taking feeding this baby.</li>
  <li>Did you know there is a reddit for people who love drinking water. Itâ€™s just relatable memes of TFW you wake up in the middle of the night very thirsty and then have a nice glass of water. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HydroHomies/">Hydro homies</a></li>
