  <li>Normally when I see someone is doing weeknotes about their actual jobs I think â€œoh here we go, thisâ€™ll be extremely boringâ€ so imagine my surprise when I clicked on <a href="https://demotive.com/weeknotes/2019/02/08/">Matâ€™s second instalment</a> which begins with the sentence:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another week of shining visions of joined-up healthcare being ground to dust by grim reality as we continue to investigate service propositions for hooking 111 online into pharmacies.</p>
</blockquote>

  <li>It ends with something even better but I donâ€™t want to spoil it for you.</li>
  <li>The other day a friend told me she absolutely hates getting compliments because she finds them incredibly patronising. This has left me with a paranoia that every time I say â€œwell doneâ€ the person Iâ€™ve said it to is thinking â€œthanks - fuck you!â€</li>
  <li>Because of the way the character â€œPaulyâ€ in the Sopranos pronounces his name (with a New Jersey accent itâ€™s more like â€œpoorlyâ€) now in our house when youâ€™re ill you say â€œIâ€™m Pauly, from New Joyseyâ€. Itâ€™s just a thing we do, OK? Anyway at the beginning of this week I was extremely Pauly from New Jersey.</li>
  <li>Last week I did some pairing with my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/_magspie">Maggie</a>. It was not very interesting work, but it was great to get to pair with someone, especially someone cool and fun like Maggie. I think we both learnt some stuff and the task I was dealing with got done much quicker because Maggie was co-pilot. I donâ€™t get to write a lot of code anymore so this kind of thing is basically living the dream.</li>
  <li>Well done to the leet hax0r that has taken up my old tumblr and started posting spam to it. I had forgotten to delete the DNS record after I deleted the Tumblr so now at my domain there is a load of crap about using photoshop. I have deleted it now, donâ€™t worry. In retrospect, I should have hung on to the Tumblr name, but I held it close to me, asked myself â€œdoes alicesews.tumblr.com spark joy?â€ and then acted accordingly. Marie Kondo hasnâ€™t, to my knowledge, done an episode on tidying up old tumblrs but I hope sheâ€™ll point out that the second you â€œdeleteâ€ a tumblr you free it up to be used by anyone else, and <em>obviously</em> delete the corresponding DNS record you n00b.</li>
  <li>I am tiiiired. Help me.</li>
  <li>If I was going to get into catfishing I would use <a href="https://twitter.com/rowanmanning">Rowan Manningâ€™s</a> profile pic.</li>
  <li>This week 5 of us had our third away-day to sort out the career paths and progression at work. After 3 days we have a rough bunch of agreed competencies and a plan for shipping them as a versioned alpha, which feels amazing.</li>
  <li>Weâ€™re moving office in May and our new bogs have those Japanese computerised bum hole washing toilets that also sing to you. I would complain about this but we also got some gender neutral bathrooms so I think everyone got what they wanted.</li>
  <li>Just did week 2 of my sewing class. I kind of zoned out last week when Julie told us what the homework was and so I ended up doing probably 2 hours more than everyone else, which is significant when a class is 3 hours.</li>
