  <li>Yesterday I walked all around Crystal Palace and listened to Malcolm Gladwellâ€™s Revisionist History. Specifically <a href="http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/27-malcolm-gladwell-s-12-rules-for-life">season 3 Episode 7</a>. The episode is about â€œagreeablenessâ€ - the extent to which your actions are affected by a desire for approval from others. It made me wonder how agreeable I am. It had some interviews with very disagreeable people, who advocate doing things that make perfect rational sense but would cause most people to recoil in horror. I think I might be quite agreeable but in combination with being veryâ€¦ <em>Looks up work personality test results</em> â€œdetermined and independentâ€. Malcolm Gladwell didnâ€™t discuss the extent to which western society conditions women to be agreeable but thatâ€™s probably a thing, right? All the very disagreeable people Malcolm interviewed were men.</li>

  <li>We played Agricola last night. I enjoyed it a lot but maybe just because I won. Iâ€™m not sure how to pronounce that name. Is it â€˜Agri-colaâ€™ (like youâ€™re saying two syllables â€˜agriâ€™ and â€˜colaâ€™) or â€˜Agricolaâ€™ (like, youâ€™re trying to get the word out as quickly as possible, so you sort of squash the â€˜iâ€™ and the â€˜oâ€™).</li>
  <li>This <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2018/10/11/memes-infowars-75-fascist-activists-red-pilled/">Bellingcat piece about â€˜red pillingâ€™</a> was super horrifying and super interesting. Iâ€™ve noticed the phrase â€˜kekâ€™ around a bit, coming out of alt-right pepÃ© shitposting accounts. I didnâ€™t think much of it - because of the people using it I had assumed it was an anti-semitic slur, but actually itâ€™s completely not that:</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kek is a term that first appeared in the MMORPG World of Warcraft. The two sides in that game, Horde and Alliance, were not supposed to communicate with one another. So when a member of one side chatted at another, their words were run through a filter to make it sound like a foreign language. When Horde players would type â€œlol,â€ it was translated as â€œkekâ€. Over time â€œkekâ€ became another way of expressing laughter online. On 4chanâ€™s /pol/ board kek took on a grander meaning and came to embody the essence of the â€œmeme magicâ€ that first made the alt-right so prominent.  The cultural rock tumbler of /pol/ eventually transmuted kek into Kekistan, a fictional ethno-state for â€œshitposters.â€</p>
