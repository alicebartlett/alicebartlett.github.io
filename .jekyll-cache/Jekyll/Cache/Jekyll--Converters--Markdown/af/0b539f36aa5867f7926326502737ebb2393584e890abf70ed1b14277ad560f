  <li>Late on the weaknotes this week because I went camping this weekend so I couldn’t post anything.</li>
  <li>E flipping loves being in a tent - she just ran around it giggling her little head off. I was very worried she would sleep really badly but actually she fell asleep very quickly and then didn’t make a peep until about 6.</li>
  <li>We’re watching Jessica Jones. The acting is bad I don’t recommend it.</li>
  <li>I’ve started spending at least 10 hours a week working on technical oversight. Having a hard rule about this is helping me make sure I spend time doing challenging technical work which is sometimes less urgent for other people but long term important for me.</li>
  <li>The real mitten is not going as well as the practice mitten but I am improving at unpicking.</li>
