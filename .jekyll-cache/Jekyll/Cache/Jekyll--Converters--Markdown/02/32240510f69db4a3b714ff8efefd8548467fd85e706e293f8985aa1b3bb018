  <li>Sorry that these are late but I am a mother of two now as u know.</li>
  <li>Womp womp. E had a temperature yesterday so now we have to isolate until we get a Covid19 test. As we donâ€™t have a car we have to get the postal one. I <em>know</em> E just has a cold and even as I type this her temperature has gone away and sheâ€™s just a bit snotty, but the guidance is what it is. Have a temperature? Isolate and get tested.</li>
  <li>We had several plans for this week that will all have to be changed until we have a negative test result. My dad was going to come up for his birthday and meet his grandson for the first time, Registering Câ€™s birth, BCG for C, long awaited haircut for me. Anyway. If weâ€™re lucky, weâ€™ll know by Wednesday and some of those plans will go through. (PRAY 4 THE HAIRCUT PPL)</li>
  <li>This week I watched The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind on Netflix, which was great and based on a true story.</li>
  <li>We watched A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood which I also really liked, although it has Tom Hanks in it and there was something about his slightly pudgy face that I found a bit distracting (Sorry Tom). This film was based on a true story about the writing of <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27134/can-you-say-hero-esq1198/">this article</a>. This film made me want to try being a really nice and good person who says slightly weird things to people but only because they so forcefully believe people are important.</li>
  <li>At some point, I have started starting sentences about something I think with â€œI meanâ€. The skit in the Kanye song â€œGet â€˜em Highâ€ has a good impression of someone who says â€œI meanâ€ a lot.
    <blockquote>
      <p>(You mean Talib, lyrics stick to your rib?)
I mean
(Thatâ€™s my favorite CD that I play in my crib)
I mean
(You donâ€™t really know him, whyâ€™s you lying?)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Previously I would have said â€œItâ€™s likeâ€, or â€œIâ€™m likeâ€. I remember being a teenager and my dad making fun of me for starting sentences with â€œlikeâ€ as if he had never picked up any kind of linguistic affectation but only spoke completely gramatically conformant english.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a29871607/tom-junod-mister-rogers-a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-true-story/">This</a> follow up interview with the original writer of â€œCan you say heroâ€ - the article on which that Mr Rogers film is based, says â€œI meanâ€  14 times.</li>
  <li>I suppose â€œI meanâ€ is just one of those linguistic trends along with â€œlikeâ€, â€œvocal fryâ€ and high rise terminals that are prevalent in some groups (of young women?) and annoy others (older men?).</li>
