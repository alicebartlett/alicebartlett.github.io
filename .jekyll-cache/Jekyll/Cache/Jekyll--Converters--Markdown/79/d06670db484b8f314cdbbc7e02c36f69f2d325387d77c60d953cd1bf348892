  <li>Somebody said ‚Äúcoffee can‚Äù and I was reminded that my dad gave me one of these once: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OID4sxCfie8. He did that because either he invented the heating mechanism or his friend did. I have forgotten. Anyway - I think the coffee was probably disgusting, but I‚Äôd like to try it now.</li>
  <li>This week I‚Äôve been listening to John Adams Ear Box at work while working. Let me tell you have been fighting the sapiosexuals off with a stick, it has been a nightmare.</li>
  <li>This week a lot of things happened. Eventually so many things that I just let them all wash over me in the hopes that later I‚Äôd be able to come up for air having not forgotten anything.</li>
  <li>Q4 baby!</li>
  <li>My granny (93?) has gone into a home. Any tips for nice things to do for people who go into homes? Except parade her great grandaughter around of course. There‚Äôll be plenty of that. Anyway. Email me.</li>
  <li>List of things I need before I can do any proper work:</li>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>External monitors exactly even with each other</li>
  <li>Empty bladder</li>
  <li>Hands moisturised but not too moisturised</li>
  <li>I have over moisturised my hands</li>
  <li>When I was little we had a childminder called sue who always had slimy over moisturised hands and sparkly bubblegum pink nail varnish. My brother and I didn‚Äôt like her but she did have a NES and flower print toilet paper which I was obsessed with.</li>
