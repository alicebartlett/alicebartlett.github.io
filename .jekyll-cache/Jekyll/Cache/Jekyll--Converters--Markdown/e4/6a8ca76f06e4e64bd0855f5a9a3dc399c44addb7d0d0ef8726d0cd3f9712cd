I"√	<ul>
  <li>Two years of weaknotes! I haven‚Äôt missed a single week. Might try marginally harder at these for a bit just so they don‚Äôt fall totally into me documenting the things I‚Äôve watched on Netflix and the things my children have said or done. That can be a project for next week though - this week, here are the things I watched on Netflix and the things my children have said or done:</li>
  <li>On Mondays I look after both children like mothers used to do in the olden days. I have no idea how women put up with this isht for so long - it is very difficult. This Monday while I was occupied with child number 2, in three separate incidents, child 1:
    <ul>
      <li>fell off the big climbing frame (I caught her after a bit of a sprint)</li>
      <li>pooped her pants</li>
      <li>weed on the carpet</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I‚Äôve started watching <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70304979">Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown</a>. I don‚Äôt know why I had never come across it before, this week I saw it on Netflix and thought ‚ÄúOK then‚Äù. After watching all three seasons of Selling Sunset I thought maybe the next thing I watched while feeding the baby should be a bit more‚Ä¶ enriching.</li>
  <li>We had builders in this week to tidy up our dining room. It‚Äôs the last room in the house that needed professional help to tidy up, or as E put it ‚Äúthe men came in and made it lovely and then they went home‚Äù.</li>
  <li>I watched the <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81092143">Rubiks Cubers</a> documentary on Netflix because <a href="https://styledeficit.tumblr.com/post/628806136693407744/these-are-good">Denise said it was good</a>. It was brilliant, I loved it. It made me feel extremely warm and fuzzy.</li>
  <li>I went to a socially distanced gathering on the pavement and in the front garden of my neighbour‚Äôs house and to my abject horror someone I didn‚Äôt know extended their had to shake mine. Reader - unable to deal with the social awkwardness of declining - I shook it.</li>
  <li>Giles wrote <a href="https://gilest.org/2020/tips-for-writing-good-weeknotes/">about how to do weeknotes</a> and it includes a bit about <a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/tag/weeknotes/">BERG‚Äôs weeknotes</a> which I then lost a good hour to. I really loved writing weeknotes at BERG. Maybe one day I‚Äôll have a job where everyone gets to write weeknotes again and they can be as silly / interesting (mine were largely silly?) as BERG‚Äôs were.</li>
