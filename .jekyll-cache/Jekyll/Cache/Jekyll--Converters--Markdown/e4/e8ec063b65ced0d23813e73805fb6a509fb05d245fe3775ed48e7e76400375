  <li>I read <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions">this about pathological liar and author Dan Mallory</a> after Dan W tweeted it. I didn‚Äôt really want to be reading it, but it sucked me in. I went to school with a pathological liar but she‚Äôs probably grown out of it by now. She used to make up all kinds of odd things - her dad (a GP) was being hounded by the press because of some scandal; she wrote a piece of music herself that I recognised to be the Moonlight Sonata ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è; one day she came to school and pretended for a whole day to have lost her voice.</li>
  <li>There are new emoji. Very excited for the flamingo. Not so excited for the small dick emoji.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôve started a sewing class at Sew Over It. I‚Äôm going to make some chroma-key cigarette pants. The new Sew Over It shop is lovely and spacious and bright. I‚Äôve got the same brilliant teacher that I had last time (Julie). She‚Äôs basically a pattern savant - can look at any bum/thigh/crotch and say what changes to the pattern need to be made.</li>
  <li>We started watching that Bill Clinton docu on Channel 4. It‚Äôs good! There is some very eighties hair happening.</li>
  <li>This week edited a hunk for the first time using git. I felt very alive and very powerful to be honest.</li>
  <li>[Chris Noth watch] OMG Chris Noth is in Catastrophe and he has white hair and a moustache!</li>
