  <li>We have mice again, as is tradition in October. Something a bit grim about being trapped in the house under a second lockdown with all this mouse poo and wee.</li>
  <li>The miceâ€™s return gives rise to a new game called â€œmouse poo or sock fluffâ€.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s Monday night and on Tuesday there is a US election. Who will win? Good luck America!</li>
  <li>Treating myself to a â€œluxury weeâ€, which is where I put some cartoons on for E and C and then get to urinate uninterrupted!</li>
  <li>Should I get a fringe?</li>
  <li>Eedle weedle got her thumb snapped in a mousetrap. I wasnâ€™t on toddler duty at the time. Her thumb is fine.</li>
  <li>I am nearly done with the wolf hall trilogy. I like the many various ways <strikethrough>Margaret Howell</strikethrough> (lol sheâ€™s the woman that does nice trousers. For some reason the name â€œHillary Mantelâ€ always evades me to be replaced with some other Laura Ashley sounding white lady name) Hillary Mantel paints Jane Seymore as being a bit dim.</li>
  <li>Is it Tory to have a financial adviser? I have a financial adviser now. I literally just need someone to shame me into filing things properly, and doing an ISA. If he can strike that balance - I feel ashamed but not so ashamed that I resent him and end the relationship - then it will have been worth it.</li>
  <li>The kind of chaotic approach I bring to finances can be summed up in the following anecdote. Legal and General sent me a cheque to pay in - they had overcharged us by Â£50. I had been planning on getting around to this at some point, paying in cheques is a massive hassle but you know, Iâ€™d do it for Â£50. <em>Also</em> half of that Â£50 is technically Lachieâ€™s soâ€¦ yeah. Anyway, this week Legal and General sent us another letter. â€œThat last cheque has expired, here is a new oneâ€. I had put off paying in the cheque for a whole year. This year I think is I will actually pay the cheque in. Just so Lachie doesnâ€™t nark on me to the financial advisor.</li>
