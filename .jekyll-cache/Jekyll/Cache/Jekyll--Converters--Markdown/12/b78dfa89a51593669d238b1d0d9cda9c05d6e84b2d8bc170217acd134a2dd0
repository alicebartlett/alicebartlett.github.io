  <li>This week my colleague, who I have said many times is too good for this world, told me that they only just realised â€œJFDIâ€ stood for â€œjust fucking do itâ€, and previously they had thought it was a Myres-Briggs type.</li>
  <li>I often misread JFDI as JEDI and think it is some kind of nerd thing.</li>
  <li>When I was at school, our drama teacher Ms Mackie had a tape in her office which had a label on it that said â€œSEX TAPEâ€. It should have said â€œSFX TAPEâ€ but somebody very funny had graffitied it.</li>
  <li>When I was in year 11 someone cleverer than me (hello Johnny Lester!) realised that my schoolâ€™s name â€œPerinâ€™s Community Schoolâ€ could easily be changed to â€œLeninâ€™s Communist Schoolâ€. Jonny was smart but he wasnâ€™t the sort of person to get up in the middle of the night and change the school sign to say â€œWelcome to Leninâ€™s Communist Schoolâ€ using tip-ex and nail polish. I guess weâ€™ll never know who did that.</li>
