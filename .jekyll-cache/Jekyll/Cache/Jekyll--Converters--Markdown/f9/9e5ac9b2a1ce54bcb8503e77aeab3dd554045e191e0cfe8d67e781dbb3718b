I"O<p>I made this <a href="https://merchantandmills.com/store/books/the-workbook/">Bantam vest</a> about two years ago I think, just before I got pregnant. I can’t remember why I never got around to photographing it, probably because I had a baby bump.</p>

<p>This fabric is so nice. It’s <a href="https://merchantandmills.com/store/cloth/tottorri-cross/">Japanese seersucker printed with small crosses</a>. When I first wore this top it was a little stiff but after a few washes it has softened up.</p>

<p>I love this vest pattern, but it’s too big for me now. Next time I’ll make a smaller size.</p>
