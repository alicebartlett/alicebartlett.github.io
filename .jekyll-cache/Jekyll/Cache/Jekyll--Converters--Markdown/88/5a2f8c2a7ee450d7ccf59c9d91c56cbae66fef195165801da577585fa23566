  <li>Like Phil, I havenâ€™t watched The Social Dilemma either, and I definitely wonâ€™t bother now. <a href="https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2020/09/17/flamethrowers-and-fire-extinguishers-a-review-of-the-social-dilemma/">This criticism</a> is all I need.</li>
  <li>We went to London Zoo last weekend (pre NCOV news). It was smashing. I wasnâ€™t really up for it because I didnâ€™t really like being surrounded by other people <em>before</em> they were all potentially harbouring a potentially lethal virus, now, even less keen. Werenâ€™t they always potentially harbouring a potentially lethal virus? Yes. But now <em>even more of them</em> are potentially harbouring an potentially lethal virus. Also - Zoos, despite their rebranding as â€œpro conservationâ€ still, to me, seem like they might be bad?</li>
  <li>Having a two and a half year old is really teaching me who I am. Feel that that wave of futility and shame as you yell â€œGET A GRIP!!!â€ at your toddler who is having another tantrum because they are overtired.</li>
  <li>There has been a case of the novel corona virus at nursery, in the room E is in, so sheâ€™s going to be at home and not allowed to leave the house until the 5th of Nov. BUCKLE UP KIDS.</li>
  <li>I am knitting the <a href="https://www.purlsoho.com/create/2018/09/24/verse-reverse-scarf/">verse and reverse scarf</a>. It has taken me about 2 weeks to knit four inches, and it needs to be 68 inches long. So - you donâ€™t need to be a Stephen Hawking to do the maths on that one. Still, at least Iâ€™m learning how to do double knit.</li>
  <li>With some embarrassment, here are some things Iâ€™ve watched on TV lately, they are of a theme:
    <ul>
      <li>Us - Bit sentimental for me. A wife (Saskia Reeves) leaves her husband and he does a lot of confused things as he processes it. I did watch all of it in about 2 days.</li>
      <li>Life - Also a bit sentimental. I also watched all of it in about 3 days</li>
      <li>Love Life - Also a bit sentimental, but with funnier writing than Us and Life.</li>
      <li>Road Kill - Another TV show where Saskia Reeves is playing the wife of a man who is not really meeting some very basic standards of husbandry<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Having worked in a Government department and a newspaper I can say that the depictions of both workplaces are very accurate. I was expecting this series to end in the downfall of the main character, or at least, some resolution on all of the various threads. Iâ€™m so used to tv shows doing that that when it ended I didnâ€™t realise I had watched the final episode until I went looking for the next one.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Is there a better album than Jay-Z / Linkin Park collision course? No.</li>
  <li>Blink 182 have released a new single called â€œquarentineâ€. I listened to it and it is bad. Tom DeLongue has left the band to chase UFOs full time and been replaced by the man from Alkaline Trio.</li>
</ul>
