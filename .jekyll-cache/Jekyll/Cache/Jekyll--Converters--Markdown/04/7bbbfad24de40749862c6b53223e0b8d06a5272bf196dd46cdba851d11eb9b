I"”<p>I read <a href="https://medium.com/@rachelcoldicutt/bye-bye-birdie-a-week-without-tweets-48b31e89336d">Rachel Coldicuttâ€™s thing about moving away from twitter</a> (Rachel - youâ€™re an influencer) and since then every time Iâ€™ve thought of something I might tweet Iâ€™ve thoughtâ€¦ maybe I wonâ€™t tweet that? I still have some things I want to say to people but where should they go? <a href="https://jennmoney.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f74a824f6424f5f5819ec0f77&amp;id=738ef47ea4">Jenn Schiffer is doing a mailing list</a> which is delightful but am I a mailing list person? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJnidRIv3o1hf_YBWjKFljg">Una Kravets</a> has a youtube channel (which I love watching!) but I definitely do not have the pep to be a youtuber. Some of the old boys on the blogging network are doing weeknotes, but Iâ€™m on maternity leave and - believe me - you <em>do not</em> want to read the weeknotes from this. They are not at all interesting. Also, what even is a week when you care for a seven month old full time.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been doing some Instagram stories but that means I have a lot of videos of my haggard face on my phone which surprise me when Iâ€™m trying to find a cute video of the baby.</p>

<p>Anyway, here we are, on my blog, or in your RSS reader. I think Iâ€™ll do weaknotes. Some collections of notes. Sometimes. Not very well written probably. Generally written with the urgency of someone who is waiting for a baby wake up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thereâ€™s a thing some people do when I tell them I donâ€™t have a sense of smell which is they say: â€œoh well, if you had to lose a sense, smell is the best one to loseâ€. I cannot dispute this, unless you are a sommelier or a perfumer then smell the least useful sense, however, hearing this does feel a bit annoying. A bit like if you met someone who didnâ€™t have a little finger, and you said â€œOh well, if you had to lose a finger, the little one is the best one to loseâ€</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m writing this in the GitHub text editor. Itâ€™s OK? Will I keep blogging like this? More to follow</li>
  <li>Yes I know my website isnâ€™t https yet. Iâ€™m sorry Mariko. I feel self conscious about this but did you know I had a baby?</li>
  <li><a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/">Russell Davies</a> does a thing on his blog where he is generally nice and not a dick about things? I might try that butâ€¦ is it my personal brand?</li>
  <li>My kitchen cupboards have been made with a single piece of plywood so the pattern on the wood is continuous from one door to the next all around the room. This makes me deliriously happy. Thank you Plykea!</li>
  <li>The baby has learnt to crawl. Itâ€™s a shame this coincides with us having mice because now there are mouse traps everywhere.</li>
  <li>I took the baby in to work yesterday and it was lovely. My colleagues are lovely.</li>
  <li>On the way back from work I bumped into a man who at first I thought worked at GDS with me so I said â€œHello!â€ and then when I realised we didnâ€™t know each other, I said â€œOh! we donâ€™t know each otherâ€ and he said â€œwell, I think we do nowâ€ and then we had an extremely nice chat. He was a theatre director and was off to try and wangle a free ticket to something or other, followed by going home and having a hot chocolate. He was impressed that I work for the Financial Times, which made me feel good about myself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thatâ€™s it. Probably. I have an RSS feed if this feels like your kind of content. If you want to comment on this post you could email me?</p>

<p>Flipping hack how do I spellcheck in the GitHub text editor. Doesnâ€™t seem fair to just post this and let Phil Gyford do it (Hi Phil!ğŸ’›)</p>
