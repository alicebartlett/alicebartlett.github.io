I"˝<p><em>[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I‚Äôve moved over from my Tumblr. I‚Äôve just copied the words and pictures across.</em></p>

<p>Hello! I‚Äôm not dead, I just moved house and that wiped out my time to sew for a while. No matter though, here are some shorts I made in July that I‚Äôve finally gotten round to photographing on this chilly November afternoon.</p>

<p>Last time I made this pattern I very wisely noted that the busy design of the fabric hides some poor tailoring (excess fabric in the crotch) and in order to make these in a plainer fabric I‚Äôd need to address that.</p>

<p>Last time, I made a size 16, and graded down to a 12/14 at the waist, which may have been the cause of the excess crotch fabric. This time I cut a straight size 14 muslin and then pinched in the waist as a v1 prototype.</p>

<p>As you can see, there is some pulling from the front to the back in these shorts.</p>

<p>From v1 I made the following adjustments for v2</p>

<p>More ease to outer hip/butt seam
Remove outer front pleat + transfer to front waist to compensate
Remove length in front crotch
Remove wedge at centre back
Here is a picture of my next version.</p>

<p>I take these photos because it‚Äôs hard to see how the fit is without contorting my body into funny shapes unless I take a photo. They‚Äôre also handy to compare with other random bums-with-fit-issues on the internet. Of course, these photos are also embarrassing for a variety of reasons, but I wanted to document the various prototypes I went through so I guess we‚Äôll all just have to deal with it.</p>

<p>Back to the prototype. The pulling is a lot better in these, as you can see. In my notes I have written ‚ÄúA weird shape: smooth curve and remove some ease in hip. Straighten the hem.‚Äù</p>

<p>So that gets us to here:</p>
