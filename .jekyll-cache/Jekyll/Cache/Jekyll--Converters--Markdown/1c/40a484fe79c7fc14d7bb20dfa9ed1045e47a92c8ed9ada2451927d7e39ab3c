  <li>This was my last week of work before maternity leave. This is now a mommy blog. Sorry about that.</li>
  <li>I ran the team social again this week - it was an online scavenger hunt. I think people enjoyed it. I hope someone takes the idea and does it better, because itâ€™s definitely ripe for a more interesting iteration. I had clues in old calendar events whose date corresponded to significant git commits, or the first (and only) mention of Node.js in the FT, clues from anagrams of peopleâ€™s names, clues in Slack channels.</li>
  <li>For a maternity leave present my team got me Â£70 of vouchers for cheese, Â£70 of vouchers for cake, and some onesies for little brother. Iâ€™m so thrilled with the cheese and cake. What a great team.</li>
  <li>After I closed my laptop on Friday afternoon I just felt extremely relieved. Working during the pandemic has been difficult and I feel very fortunate to be able to just nope out of it because of maternity leave. Iâ€™mâ€™ apprehensive about what kind of workplace Iâ€™ll return to and the changes my team will have gone through, but thatâ€™s a problem for 9 months time tbh.</li>
  <li>Went in to check on E and found a mosquito having a good chow down on her foot. Honestly I am having far too many emotions about this - fury, guilt, despair. Needless to say the mosquito is dead.</li>
  <li>I feel incredibly bored of my home after 13 weeks of not venturing more than ~2 miles from it. I just want to go and be somewhere else. Luckily for me, something incredible is about to happen and I will be bored no more.</li>
