  <li>I am ideologically opposed to wine glasses.</li>
  <li>E has head lice again (!!!). Iâ€™m now very knowledgeable about the lifecycle of the head louse. Did you know one female louse can lay about 150 eggs in her lifetime, which is usually about a month. And she only has to mate once? Iâ€™m beginning to suspect that since E first got them a year ago the nursery has actually never been rid of head lice and theyâ€™re just getting passed around. I had a spirited argument with the new nursery manager about her slowness in emailing the parents to tell them about the head lice. It was the first time Iâ€™d spoken to her, so thatâ€™s a strong first impression.</li>
  <li>I listened to The Party by Elizabeth Day this week. Alex Fem Friday who reads a lot suggested it. I got through it very quickly, probably because of the many opportunities for listening to audiobooks there are when looking after a baby. I even earned Audibleâ€™s â€œMarathonerâ€ badge. Not sure why Audible have gamified the already pleasurable activity of reading butâ€¦ OK.</li>
  <li>I liked â€œThe Partyâ€. All the characters are totally horrible, even the one Iâ€™m probably supposed to like, Lucy, I reckon Iâ€™d find extremely boring in real life. Did he kill the cat in the end? What do we think?</li>
  <li>Iâ€™ve moved on to the Hillary Mantel books. I donâ€™t like historical fiction, but as Alex pointed out, it must be quite good even for historical fiction. If youâ€™re going to read some historical fiction you should go for the Woolf Hall trilogy. Iâ€™m finding it a bit hard going as an audiobook because the prose style requires that I concentrate.</li>
  <li>The dining room redecoration continues. On Friday we stripped the floors.</li>
  <li>Like everyone else, I read <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/09/k-overlooked-variable-driving-pandemic/616548/">this thing about things we now know about Covid-19 in the Atlantic</a>.</li>
