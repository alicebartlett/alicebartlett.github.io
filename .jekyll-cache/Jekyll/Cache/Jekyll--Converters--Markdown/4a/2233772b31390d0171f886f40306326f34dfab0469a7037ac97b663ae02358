  <li>When I was expecting E, <a href="https://twitter.com/eliotfineberg">Eliot</a> told me that sometimes his daughter does something odd or funny and then he realises - â€œoh - I do that, sheâ€™s picked that up from me!â€</li>
  <li>Yesterday E (wearing only a nappy and t-shirt) walked into our bedroom, picked up a sports bra, put her head through an arm hole, said â€œIâ€™m goinâ€™ shoppinâ€™â€ and walked out. It was like looking in a mirror.</li>
  <li>It was Lionel Barberâ€™s final day at the FT after 14 years as editor on Thursday. I went to the editorial floor for the final speeches and the banging out.</li>
  <li>Banging out is a Fleet St tradition where journalists will bang their desks when a leaving journalist exits the building for the last time. The louder and more vigorous the banging - the more respected the journalist. To not bang is considered serious shade.</li>
  <li>The banging is quite something - really thunderous, almost primal, quite intimidating.</li>
  <li>The first time I witnessed a banging out I didnâ€™t know what it was or why it was happening and it was actually quite scary.</li>
  <li>In Lionelâ€™s leaving speech he told us a couple of funny stories. The time he walked in on the Arch Bishop of Canterbury naked due to a hotel room mix up was a good one. Also quite a few stories about being shouted about by politicians.</li>
  <li>For anyone wondering - <a href="https://notes.annagoss.co/post/190178284000/could-end-in-burning-flames-or-paradise-13">Anna</a> has cleared up the â€œhave I met Anna Gossâ€ question from last week in a way that really satisfies the feeling I have that we might have met. Because we literally <em>could have met</em> in Beckenham Place Park at least once. I didnâ€™t see Anna but she saw me. I hope I wasnâ€™t doing anything embarrassing.</li>
  <li>On Monday night I witnessed some crime. It was 4:30am and I had been awake since 3 because E had decided to cry relentlessly for an hour and I still hadnâ€™t managed to get back to sleep. Then I heard â€œwhaeyyyy <em>CRACK</em>â€. I looked out of the window and there was a man knocking all the kerbside wing mirrors off the cars on my street. I phoned the police, who were clearly a bit bored because they sent a squad car and a van but he had gone by the time they arrived.</li>
  <li>The next day I noticed he had damaged quite a few cars, so where I knew which house corresponded to which car I knocked on the door to give them the police incident number and tell them what had happened.</li>
  <li>This led to a weird conversation with <em>Les*</em>, a pipe smoking retired police officer, who asked me immediately if the perp was wearing a hoodie, then checked I was OK and that I had a husband at home and I wasnâ€™t alone with the baby. His ancient Volvo 265 is going to be a nightmare to fix because they donâ€™t make wing mirrors for them anymore.</li>
  <li><em>*not his real name.</em></li>
