I"Ğ<p>Russell Davies has covered the basics of presentations <a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2015/11/doing-presentations.html">over on his blog</a>, Iâ€™m not going to rehash what heâ€™s said there. Heâ€™s covered <a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2015/06/doing-the-hard-work-to-make-it-big.html">making slides readable</a>, <a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2015/06/doing-the-hard-work-to-make-it-clear.html">making ideas clear</a>, <a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2015/06/doing-the-hard-work-to-make-it-bearable.html">managing audience attention</a> and finally <a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2015/07/one-more-thing.html">not putting pictures of money on slides about budgets</a>. You should probably read those before you read this.</p>

<p>These posts are terrific, so I thought Iâ€™d wrap all of his advice (and some of my own) up into a white-label keynote theme that people can then build on top of.</p>

<p>Sometimes presentations are for big auditoriums, where people are barely paying attention and itâ€™s warm and dark, and sometimes presentations are for rooms of 10 people. The slide deck you create for the highly engaged 10 person audience is not the same as the one you write for the 500 person audience.</p>

<p>This blog post is about presentations for a big audience.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the theme:  <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/slides-blog-post/whitelabel_theme.zip">Keynote</a>, <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/slides-blog-post/whitelabel_theme.potx">Powerpoint</a> (thanks, <a href="https://twitter.com/danblundell/status/719448454976651265">Dan!</a>), <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19F5pQqnLc52-KBsvTZ7oloOvomkNW8A7tX98a3KOohY/edit">Google slides</a> (thanks, <a href="https://twitter.com/mildlydiverting/status/721323173418049536">Kim!</a>). Now Iâ€™m going to talk about each slide in it.</p>

<h2 id="your-basic-slide">Your basic slide</h2>

<p>First things first, you need a basic slide. The design of these slides is about lessening the impact of things that go wrong with technology.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve used a system font so that if I have to present off someone elseâ€™s computer, theyâ€™ll definitely have the font installed and my formatting wonâ€™t unexpectedly break.</p>

<p>Most of these slides use a dark on light design so that if the projector is terrible and the room is really bright, youâ€™ll still be able to read them. <a href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/11/29/choosing-presentation-color-scheme">Rebecca Murphey has a good post on this</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve used big margins at the left, right and top so if the projector isnâ€™t lined up properly with the screen none of my important words will go missing.</p>

<p>In case someone comes in half way through, put some way of finding out who you are (your name or Twitter handle) on the slide.</p>

<h2 id="a-basic-slide-with-a-picture">A basic slide with a picture</h2>

<p>Keeping in mind Russellâ€™s advice: â€œIllustrate, donâ€™t decorateâ€, sometimes I need pictures with some text.</p>

<h2 id="a-blank-slide">A blank slide</h2>

<p>My keynote theme has a completely blank slide for charts and diagrams. Charts and diagrams are where even good presenters can get into trouble. My only advice is make your labels as big as possible, and think carefully about what youâ€™re trying to show. People looking at a chart or diagram in a report have more time to pore over it than they do when looking at your slide in a presentation. Manage your audienceâ€™s focus by highlighting the important bits of a chart, and obscuring the other bits.</p>

<h2 id="your-title-slide">Your title slide</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s a really really good idea to have a title slide. It means that while youâ€™re futzing around with the presenter display in the pre-talk bit the audience isnâ€™t reading your slides, theyâ€™re just looking at your name and the title of your talk. Again, give people a way to find out more about you and what youâ€™re talking about.</p>

<h2 id="a-navigation-y-slide">A navigation-y slide</h2>
<p>As <a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2015/06/doing-the-hard-work-to-make-it-bearable.html">Russell says,</a> your talk should have some kind of structure and you should tell people what that structure is. I like to use a different colour background my navigation and structure slides.</p>

<h2 id="a-slide-for-quotes">A slide for quotes</h2>
<p>Quoting people in talks is good. Have a design for that. Make sure thereâ€™s somewhere visible for the attribution of the quote. Attributions are both classy <em>and</em> mean people can look stuff up later.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/slides-blog-post/quote.jpeg" alt="A design for quotes" /></p>

<p>If you can find a good photograph of the person youâ€™re quoting, include that to remind people who this person is.</p>

<h2 id="a-slide-for-showing-a-picture-of-a-website">A slide for showing a picture of a website</h2>
<p>YMMV but I show a lot of pictures of websites in my talks. Make sure theyâ€™re are as big as possible, nobody needs to see all that browser chrome. Make sure thereâ€™s a place for the url of the page (leaving the address bar in will be too small).</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/slides-blog-post/website.jpeg" alt="website" /></p>

<p>If you want to draw attention to a particular part of a website, make sure you have a design for that too. I like to darken the bits of a page or diagram that arenâ€™t important.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/slides-blog-post/website_with_highlight.jpeg" alt="Website with highlight" /></p>

<p>I also have a design for showing a page in a mobile browser.</p>

<h2 id="a-slide-for-your-power-quotes">A slide for your â€œpower quotesâ€</h2>

<p>Before I spoke at Nordic.js, they asked me for my talkâ€™s â€œpower quotesâ€ so that as I gave my talk, they could tweet the important bits. This is quite a good idea really, it helps get the thing you want to say in front of more people. To help my points carry further, I put the really important stuff on itâ€™s own slide and make sure itâ€™s big enough to photograph from the audience.</p>

<h2 id="a-closing-slide">A closing slide</h2>

<p>At the end of your talk, thereâ€™s a finishing slide. Something to say â€œthanks for having me, go here for more informationâ€.</p>
