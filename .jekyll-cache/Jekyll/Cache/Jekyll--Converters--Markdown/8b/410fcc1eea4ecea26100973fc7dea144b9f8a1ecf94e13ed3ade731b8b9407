I"*<p><em>[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I’ve moved over from my Tumblr. I’ve just copied the words and pictures across.</em></p>

<p>I made this shirt back in January because I really needed another winter shirt. Shooting things I’ve made in winter is such a drag, because of the bad light, that it’s taken this long for me to post it up here. It’s not like I hate this shirt, it’s just that I made it because I needed it, I’m kind of over it.</p>

<p>Also! I had to take all of these photos myself because Lachie is on a stag do this weekend.</p>

<p>The sleeves are too wide for some reason. Still unsure what I messed up there, but I just sort of hoik them up and it’s alright.</p>

<p>The back of this shirt is such a non-event, I’m not sure why I’m including this photo. OH WELL. KEEP SCROLLING.</p>

<p>Quite pleased with the length of this shirt, and where it hits me on the side.</p>

<p>Little “blog” gang sign there for everyone reading this in 2005.</p>

<p>The fabric is from http://raystitch.co.uk/. The buttons are from Kleins in Soho. The pattern is “Archer” from http://shop.grainlinestudio.com/products/archer-button-up-shirt. This is the 5th Archer I’ve made, but the third that’s for me.</p>
