  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/lukekavanagh_">Luke</a> showed me where to find the Financial Times style guide. I have spent hours reading it. As you would expect there is lots to enjoy. The bits about journalistic cliché’s are my favourite. Things like:
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>scrambling</strong>
There are too many people scrambling to do something in the FT. Let them hurry if they must or even try.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>The bit about apostrophes is good too:
    <blockquote>
      <p>The apostrophe (‘) is not dead but it is dying. It has left Earls Court and St Andrews, but not yet Regent’s Park; and it has vanished from companies such as Barclays Bank and Currys, and magazine titles such as Farmers Weekly. […]</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>This advice about puns needs to be more widely embraced:
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>puns</strong>
[…]
It is unreasonable to expect all […] puns to be banned from the pages of the FT, particularly in features, in Weekend FT and on the Arts page. But think carefully before you commit yourself: is the pun apt? is it funny? is it new?</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>IS IT APT? IS IT FUNNY? IS IT NEW? Next time someone puns near me (I know who it will be, I sit near a <em>prolific</em> punner) I’m going to say this to them.</p>

  <li><a href="https://natbuckley.co.uk/2019/01/20/weeknotes-1-tv-ads-and-business-models/">Nat is doing weeknotes</a> and they are much more interesting than mine. I’m furious!</li>
  <li>What is the German compound noun for when you’re upset but basically keeping it together and then somebody is nice to you and you fall into a million pieces?</li>
  <li>Shout out to my fellow disciples of “12-1 is the one true lunch hour”</li>
  <li>wooof I am very tired this week.</li>
  <li>I listened to <a href="https://www.originsthepodcast.com/">the rest of this Origins podcast about Sex and The City</a>. It’s put together quite poorly but some of the interviews are so good. Worth it for how cross Chris Noth is alone.</li>
