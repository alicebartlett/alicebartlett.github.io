I"P<p>The other day I threw some clean clothes on my infant son and thought “god - he looks like he’s about to pop to B&amp;Q and then down spoons with his mates to watch the game. He’ll stumble in at 4pm scratching his balls and asking what’s for dinner before falling into a sweaty sleep on the sofa. I want <em>my</em> son to be a poet, or at least an accountant who has read some poetry”. Why are all affordable baby clothes so aggressively heteronormative? Anyway. That was the prompt I needed to finish this lullaby layette set which I cut a long time ago but didn’t manage to sew up.</p>

<h2 id="the-onesie">The Onesie</h2>
<p>The onesie is for a baby aged 3-6 months, which my baby was once. It no longer fits him because he is, as I keep telling him, <em>such a big boy now yes he is</em>. The fabric was from Cloth House, the body is called <a href="https://www.clothhouse.com/cotton-prints-stripes-checks/japanese-wind">“Japanese Wind White”</a>, and the binding is <a href="https://www.clothhouse.com/cotton-prints-stripes-checks/japanese-wind-navy">“Japanese Wind Navy”</a>. Those links don’t work at the moment because the website is “closed for Christmas” (lol ok).</p>

<p>This was really fun to sew and my son looked extremely cute in it. This onesie works well in summer but looks a bit strange under trousers because it is so puffy around the tum.</p>

<h2 id="the-jacket">The Jacket</h2>
<p>This jacket is reversible and I am obsessed <em>obsessed</em> with this <a href="https://www.clothhouse.com/cotton-prints-stripes-checks/japanese-small-rabbit-blue">rabbit fabric</a> which I used as a lining. It’s also from Cloth House. The outer fabric is some leftover <a href="https://merchantandmills.com/store/cloth/tottorri-cross/">Japanese seersucker printed with small crosses</a> which I made a vest out of a while back. Using seersucker has given this jacket a crumpled quality which hopefully means I won’t have to iron it because nobody has time for that.</p>

<h2 id="the-trousers">The Trousers</h2>
<p>These were great. Fun to sew, very sturdy feeling with lots of room for baby to roll and wiggle around in. I made them using some corduroy from Merchant and Mills leftover from a shirt I made a while back. They appear to have sold out of it. Annoyingly I cut one of the pockets upside down so it has the wrong NAP to the other one 🤦🏻‍♀️. He won’t care I guess. He doesn’t even know he has hands.</p>

<p>I’d like to make these again but also these babies man, they really eat into the sewing time.</p>
