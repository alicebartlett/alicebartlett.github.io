I"õ<p>Back in March beforeâ€¦ all thisâ€¦ I went to Rye with Nat. It was a lovely day. I was 5 months pregnant and we mostly went to the Merchant and Mills shop and tried to work out how long we could leave it between eating things.</p>

<p>On that trip I bought some <a href="https://merchantandmills.com/store/cloth/sustainable/tencel/tencel-twill-aperitivo/">tencel twill</a>. It has the most lovely drape. It feels very luxurious.</p>

<p>I made another Florence top, but of course I was quite pregnant by the time I finished it. So here we are now, in December, Iâ€™ve finally gotten around to photographing it.</p>
