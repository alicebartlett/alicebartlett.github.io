  <li>Welp</li>
  <li>Are we half way through the lockdown yet? It‚Äôs weird not knowing how much longer the current routine will go on for.</li>
  <li><a href="https://chee.snoot.club/">Chee</a> reminded me that it‚Äôs possible to be both ‚Äúlucky‚Äù and ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù which was very important for me to hear in that moment because a compounding factor in just how bad I feel about this whole situation is how bad I feel about how bad I feel. Like - how pathetic to be doing this badly when I have a garden, an understanding job, and supportive partner, plenty of money and a cute toddler.</li>
  <li>Edds showed up on a bike ride as a surprise and I felt such a surge of emotion that I thought I was going to cry.</li>
  <li>I watched this interview with <a href="https://www.ft.com/video/96240572-7e35-4fcd-aecb-8f503d529354">Emmanuel Macron in the FT</a> (free to view). I don‚Äôt really know a lot about Macron, I‚Äôve seen him speak before but this is the first time I‚Äôve seen him interviewed and bloody hell. The write up of the interview, says this:
    <blockquote>
      <p>The usually tactile Mr Macron ‚Äî of whom it was once said that ‚Äúhe could seduce a chair‚Äù</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Yep that about sums it up.</li>
  <li>Also - what a different kind of politician to, say, Boris - full of ideas, happy and interested to talk about them, appearing to be thinking through and turning things over as he answers questions.</li>
  <li>Red button subscribers can ask me further about the Macron interview as I have other things to say but they are not for the weaknotes.</li>
  <li>As in life, my favourite thing about Animal Crossing is the gardening. Shrubs, flowers, trees. I am obsessed.</li>
