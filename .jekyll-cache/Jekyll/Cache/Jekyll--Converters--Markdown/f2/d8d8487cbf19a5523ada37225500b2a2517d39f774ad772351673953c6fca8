I"B	<p><em>[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I’ve moved over from my Tumblr. I’ve just copied the words and pictures across.</em></p>

<p>Two posts in a week! Lucky you! This is the Tamarack jacket from Butt Kitchen favourite: Grainline. This jacket is very simple to construct with a few slightly more advanced techniques like quilting, bias binding and welt pockets thrown in.</p>

<p>Normally I lengthen patterns by a few cm, but this time I didn’t bother, and just cut a straight size UK 14 without alterations.</p>

<p>Because I’m extremely lazy I bought some quilted fabric from <a href="https://shop.missmatatabi.com/">Miss Matabi’s store</a>. It’s fleece on one side and polyester on the other.</p>

<p>The over-all effect of using this type of fabric for this project is the jacket has turned out a bit… dog walker-y? Like I’m about to take the terriers out for a romp across the common you know?</p>

<p>Here’s a photo of me mean mugging in a gritty urban setting to offset the rural vibe of this jacket, anyway.</p>

<p>Although in photos this fabric is navy, in real life it’s a blue-y green colour which is really beautiful.</p>

<p>I accidentally used the wrong width binding, which is a bit annoying but I’m not sure most people would notice unless they’d seen the pattern. Also, as you can see, some of the binding is a bit wonky because it was such a fiddle to sew with.</p>

<p>I’m really pleased with the pockets. Jen’s instructions for sewing them were really clear and straightforward and these are by far the neatest welt pockets I’ve ever managed. I lined them with some leftover fabric from a shirt I made for a friend earlier in the year.</p>

<p>Overall, this was a fun project and I now have a warm-ish “transitional” coat. There are some other quite nice versions of this coat <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/tamarackjacket/">showing up on instagram</a> that you might want to check out.</p>
