<p><em>[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I’ve moved over from my Tumblr. I’ve just copied the words and pictures across.</em></p>

<p>I made another <a href="https://grainlinestudio.com/?s=tamarack">Tamarack</a>! Grainline released a pattern update which added an option to close it with snaps instead of hook and eyes. I like my <a href="http://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/tamarack">first Tamarack</a>, I’ve got a lot of wear out of it, but it was quite poorly finished (especially the inner seams) and I wasn’t happy with how the front pockets began to gape forward from having my hands in them.</p>

<p>There was also something a bit dog walkery about the fabric.</p>

<p>With this reboot, I used a thin indigo denim from <a href="https://www.dittofabrics.co.uk/">Ditto Fabrics</a> in Brighton. The lining is from <a href="https://raystitch.co.uk/">Ray Stitch</a>, it’s been in my stash for a while.</p>

<p>In the last version of this jacket I used the wrong width binding. It turns out that the instructions describe a 1/2″ double fold bias binding, but John Lewis seems to measure bias binding by the total width, so in John Lewis language, you want 1 inch bias tape, not a 1/2″. This might be a US/UK thing. It’s not interesting, but it is true.</p>

<p>SNAPS. I’d never used snaps before but inserting them is heaps of fun and the look really profesh so I’ll definitely use them again.</p>

<p>Yeah I really like this coat.</p>
