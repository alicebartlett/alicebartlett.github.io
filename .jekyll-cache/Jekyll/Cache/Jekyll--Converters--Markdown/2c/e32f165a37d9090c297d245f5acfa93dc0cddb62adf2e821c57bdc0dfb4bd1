  <li>Look at this! You‚Äôre now reading this over https. I thought it was going to be annoying to set up and I might have to‚Ä¶ understand DNS or know what an A record is, but actually I only needed to update some IP addresses in Gandi and then check a checkbox in GitHub. This has definitely been made easier for me by the eggheads at GitHub since I last tried to do this so‚Ä¶ well done eggs.</li>
  <li>[Eco NEWS] I read <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47161379?fbclid=IwAR2paGhHI1OI__6FNQx9ycRJjMO4sMl55UwyH1IirCDNhX-PctU_5xkRVx0">this thing</a> about packaging and now I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm supposed to buy plastic free spinach or bagged spinach.

    <ol>
      <li>I feel stupid for saying this but finally a lot of Ru Paul‚Äôs Drag Race makes sense.</li>
      <li>I‚Äôm not sure I can watch any more of it, because I think some of the acting might be bad?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>I planted out my sweet peas, and potted on my other cut flowers.</li>
  <li>Fleabag was good wasn‚Äôt it?</li>
  <li>FFFFFFFFFFFFFF I am so tired.</li>
