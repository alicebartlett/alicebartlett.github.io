  <li>I feel like a ghost.</li>
  <li>I am very behind (like, six months) on <a href="http://tampon.club">Tampon Club</a> emails. Sorry if you’re waiting for stickers. I have lost them in my house somewhere. I know. I know.</li>
  <li>I have realised a thing about the diet coke ad that I talked about <a href="http://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-12">last week</a>. The man in this ad is actually walking past (and greets) the woman from the April version of the ad! My small mind was quite pleased to have noticed that.</li>
  <li>I got a nice email from someone that I don’t know to say they like my weaknotes. Thank you internet stranger! I don’t know why people read these, but it’s nice when people do.</li>
  <li>At work something cool happened, which I’ll have to be deliberately vague about, but basically the FT data team has been working on some machine learning stuff and unlike a lot of machine learning things it actually seems quite good and well thought out and like it might serve a useful purpose? Anyway, perhaps someone will write something proper about it somewhere one day. I hope they do.</li>
  <li>Another work update. The Editor of the FT is an extremely impressive person. Even my attempts to describe how impressive he is feel clumsy and stupid so I won’t bother. Anyway. Here is the thing. I once stood behind him in the queue at the canteen where this incredibly articulate and well-read man lamented the fact that they had stopped selling ham and cheese croissants. <em>Ham and cheese</em>. “He puts his trousers on one leg at a time just like everybody else”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>Anna has written a <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/interviewing-fairly.html">good post on hiring</a>.</li>
  <li>OK I’m going to try and work out where those Tampon Club stickers are now.</li>

      <p>Once Lachie heard this and decided to prove that it was possible to put a pair of pants on two legs at a time. It took several attempts but he did manage to jump into them eventually. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
