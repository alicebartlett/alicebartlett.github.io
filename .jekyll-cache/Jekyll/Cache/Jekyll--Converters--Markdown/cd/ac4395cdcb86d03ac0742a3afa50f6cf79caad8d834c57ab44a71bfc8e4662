  <li>Lachie has taken Edith out so I am back in bed eating an out of date chocolate muffin which I have microwaved so it will taste less stale.</li>
  <li>Working is good isnâ€™t it? Itâ€™s quite busy and feels like there is a lot to do, but I think I am effectively prioritising things. Iâ€™m trying very hard not to do any work at the weekends or evenings but I desperately want to because itâ€™s extremely satisfying.</li>
  <li>Edith has some suspicious spots that seem a littleâ€¦ chicken poxy? I have spent too much time looking at disgusting rashes on the internet since having a baby tbh.</li>
  <li>Oh god this muffin is good</li>
  <li>On the topic of muffins, isnâ€™t it awful when you eat a muffin only to realise itâ€™s jam filled? Yes it is awful.</li>
  <li>What is the deal with people who use South Park characters for their slack icons? <em>What is their deal?</em></li>
  <li>Having to pump at work while also having a periods reminds me of this tweet - possibly the greatest tweet of all time: <a href="https://twitter.com/IamEnidColeslaw/status/351425828606849024">https://twitter.com/IamEnidColeslaw/status/351425828606849024</a></li>
