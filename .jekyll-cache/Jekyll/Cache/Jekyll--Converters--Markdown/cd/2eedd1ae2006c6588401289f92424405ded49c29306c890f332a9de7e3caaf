  <li>This week, because E was home from nursery, I looked after both kids by myself during the day for five days in a row. And because E was isolating, we couldnâ€™t leave the house. I know, I know, is this the single most courageous and extraordinary act in human history? I will let the public decide.</li>
  <li>I am locked in a battle of will with my two and a half year old over who is in charge. She thinks itâ€™s her, and I think itâ€™s her most of the time but a line must be drawn at her watching â€œTeeBeeâ€ all day, drawing by holding the felt tip up her nose, and doing something I call â€œgetting into thingsâ€ which is just her pulling things apart (books, clothes, plants).</li>
  <li>This week I made <a href="https://thehappyfoodie.co.uk/recipes/banana-loaf">banana bread</a> because we had some old bananas, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/oct/04/nigel-slater-green-tomato-recipes">more chutney</a>(Nigel Slater this time) to deal with the green tomatoes and <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/playdough-recipe">play dough</a>(coloured with â€œ<a href="https://culturehustle.com/products/pink-50g-powdered-paint-by-stuart-semple?variant=26678016329&amp;currency=GBP&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=gs-2019-02-24&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=smart_campaign&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw59n8BRD2ARIsAAmgPmJol_IBJs9lLAp7LLFrtBQOF3CABlnqmldI1-C9EWpvbtsdINW5pfgaAinkEALw_wcB">the worldâ€™s pinkest pink pigment</a>â€ rather than food colouring) and <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-make-salt-dough-recipe">salt dough</a> Christmas tree decorations.</li>
  <li>E had a slightly suspicious cough which we thought amounted to â€œcontinuousâ€ so we took her for a test on Monday, and as of Friday night, we still donâ€™t have any results back. [update] just phoned the test people and after ~20 mins on the phone they said they had lost the test and would launch an investigation. lol ok. Eâ€™s symptoms are fine again.</li>
  <li>I managed to get an hour on my bike last weekend. Hoping for another hour this weekend.</li>
