I"e<p><em>[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I’ve moved over from my Tumblr. I’ve just copied the words and pictures across.</em></p>

<p>Now for something a little more refined after the tropical trouser situation in the previous post. This is the <a href="https://merchantandmills.com/store/patterns/the-camber-set/">Camber Top from Merchant and Mills</a>. It’s not at all obvious from any of these photographs, but I love it!</p>

<h2 id="pattern">Pattern</h2>
<p>I cut a size 12, which is smaller than I’d normally cut, but Merchant and Mills patterns have a lot of ease so I figured it would be fine. It fits me ok around the torso but I think I’d prefer a bit more room in the shoulders. Next time I make this pattern I’ll lengthen the shoulder seams I think.</p>

<h2 id="fabric">Fabric</h2>
<p>The material is this <a href="https://merchantandmills.com/products/cotton/handloom-criss-cross-cotton/">criss-cross handloom cotton</a>, also from Merchant and Mills. I think it’s quite lovely. I’m not normally someone who can wear white without immediately spilling something on myself, so this is a bold and unprecedented sartorial move for me. Yeah you heard me.</p>
