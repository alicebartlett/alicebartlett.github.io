I"¬<p>Itâ€™s been eight months since I joined the Financial Times to work on their components system, Origami. Iâ€™m the tech lead, or platform head, depending on what end of the telescope youâ€™re looking down. Is that the right metaphor? Who knows.</p>

<p>I prefer â€œtech leadâ€ but that doesnâ€™t cover some of the other things I have to do in the role which are less about tech decisions and more about reporting upwards.</p>

<p>Anyway. This post isnâ€™t about that. Itâ€™s to say that <a href="http://engineroom.ft.com/2016/06/20/origami-and-177-ft-sites/">Iâ€™ve written a blog post about Origami</a> over on the Financial Timesâ€™ tech blog. There will be some more posts in the future about what weâ€™re doing with Origami and why, but first I needed to lay some ground-work about the Financial Times.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re working on something similar, especially if youâ€™re working in publishing, Iâ€™d love to hear from you.</p>
