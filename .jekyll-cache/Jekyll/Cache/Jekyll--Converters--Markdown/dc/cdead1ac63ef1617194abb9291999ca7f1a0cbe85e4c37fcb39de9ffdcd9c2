  <li>Ever caught a turd as it falls from a toddlerâ€™s bottom with an unread copy of the Guardian? I have.</li>
  <li>Someone at nursery commented that E wears a lot of pink. She does because most of her clothes are hand-me-downs from girls who wore a lot of pink. â€œIâ€™ll show themâ€ I thought. This week I dyed all her pink clothes orange. It was a choice between orange or red (because the starting colour was pink and I didnâ€™t want to end up with weird shades of purple or brown), and I prefer orange. I didnâ€™t really think about it, but I had imagined a kind of muted peachy shade of orange. Dylon had other ideas and  she now has is a lot of clothes that are the colour of US prison jump suits.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™ve started knitting a jumper. Not sure which child this will end up on because I still canâ€™t knit things to a specified size. Yes I have heard of tension squares, Iâ€™m just not a very reliable knitter.</li>
  <li>For anyone who thinks cryptic crosswords are all clues about cricket, species of bird, and the tudors, you should know that this weekâ€™s everyman (along with a clue about one of Henry VIIâ€™s second wife) also had a clue whose answer was the Season 10 winner of Ru Paulâ€™s Drag Race. Something for everybody.</li>
