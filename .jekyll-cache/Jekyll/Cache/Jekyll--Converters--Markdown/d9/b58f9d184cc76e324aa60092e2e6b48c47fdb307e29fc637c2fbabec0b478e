  <li>I watch Have I Got News For You. I know Iâ€™m not supposed to like it because itâ€™s establishment men being smug about the news but I do OK?</li>
  <li>Anyway <em>anyway</em> I watched the first social distancing episode and <em>my god</em> I have not seen any telly that bad ever in my life. It was excruciating. They were all dialling from their respective homes and of course there was no live audience.</li>
  <li>Firstly - somebody please get these men a green stick, they look like theyâ€™ve been boiled. (Steph McGovern was hosting and looked great, presumably because sheâ€™s been paying attention in hair and makeup).</li>
  <li>Secondly - not only is this not funny it is also really uncomfortable. Itâ€™s awkward. Itâ€™s four strangers at a dinner party who have been told to be funny. Despite the fact that it would have been edited, the timing was still off.</li>
  <li>I had to leave the room.</li>
  <li>Nice weather eh?</li>
  <li>I had a bit of a funny interaction with the local garden centre. They sent me the following email in response to a question about what varieties of strawberries they had:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Thank you for your email.  strawberries
pegasus, red gauntlet, florence, elsante, alice, sweet heart please call the shop to confirm and make payment for this
[REDACTED PHONE NUMBER]
we are extremely busy
thanks</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>How rude I thought. Donâ€™t call me sweetheart. Do you want my business or not?</li>
  <li>I nearly didnâ€™t respond because I was so narked off by the tone, but then I did because I do actually really want some strawberry plants as last years ones have root weevils and are looking very sad.</li>
  <li>Anyway, when the plants arrived I looked at the handwritten notes from our conversation:
    <blockquote>
      <p>strawberry varieties</p>
      <ul>
        <li>pegasus,</li>
        <li>red gauntlet,</li>
        <li>florence,</li>
        <li>elsante,</li>
        <li>alice,</li>
        <li>sweet heart</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>So - Alice, and Sweet Heart are both varieties of strawberry, apparently, and sometimes people are just giving you lists of strawberries rather than being rude.</li>
</ul>
