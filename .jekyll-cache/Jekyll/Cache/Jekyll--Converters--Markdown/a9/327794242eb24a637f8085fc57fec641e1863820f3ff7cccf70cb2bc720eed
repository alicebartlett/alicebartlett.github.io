  <li>Happy New Year to all those that celebrate. On Radio 4 last week there was a woman who was asked if she was glad 2020 was over and very smugly replied that years are just arbitrary concepts and so she didnâ€™t think one ending was important or significant. It annoyed me. I donâ€™t disagree but can we just <em>let the basic people who find comfort in marking the passage of time live?!</em>. Havenâ€™t they been through enough? Anyway. To all the time truthers out there - I see you, but save it for when weâ€™re all feeling a bit less emotionally worn.</li>
  <li>We spent the void between Christmas and New Year, 2020â€™s gooch if you prefer, on the edge of the Peak District with my in-laws. I spent it reading Monty Donâ€™s new book, looking at the bird table and trying to work out if those are coal tits, blue tits or great tits (stop laughing at the back). I identified a nuthatch. It snowed the second day we were here, so Lachie and I made an igloo which our nearly-three-year-old very wisely refused to go in. We went sledding. We walked to the one place there is to walk to - a coffee shop. Itâ€™s is on a road, so definitely accessible via car, but I have no idea how that road connects to the roads here as I have only ever gotten to it over a variety of fields and bridleways. The snow made everything seem otherworldly. I saw a lot of robins sitting on snowy fenceposts, turning each still moment into a British Heart Foundation Christmas card.</li>
  <li>Monty Donâ€™s book is a lot like Gardenerâ€™s World. Slow, warm, relaxing. Short dispatches from his house near Monmouth. Iâ€™m learning a lot about birds -

      <li>Robins used to be called ruddocks, and then redbreasts, and then finally robins. Redbreast is a name that predates the arrival oranges, and the concept of â€œorangeâ€. If weâ€™d had the word â€œorangeâ€ at the time weâ€™d probably have called them â€œorangebreastsâ€ (or not, because that sounds rubbish). I guess the same goes for red squirrels and people with red hair.</li>
      <li>Moles eat worms by biting off their noses and then leaving them, alive but paralysed, in the walls of their tunnels for later.</li>
      <li>The only birdsongs I remember from growing up are those of the wood pigeon (coo coooo coo) and chaffinch, which is a tweety up-down thing that sounds like someone excitedly saying â€œcheep cheep cheep cheep <em>cheep cheep cheep cheep</em> itâ€™s a sneak preview!â€. Iâ€™ve never heard the chaffinch sound anywhere else and when I returned home this year I noticed the song was similar but had more trills than I remember. Well, thank you Monty Don for explaining that mystery to me - itâ€™s because chaffinch songs are passed between generations, with each new generation adding its own variations, causing them to change over time.</li>
