<p>Fabric: This is a cross-weave from Cloth House (47 Berwick st). Itâ€™s possibly a bit see-through and because itâ€™s cross-weave it washes funny and always needs a good iron.</p>

<p>Pattern: <a href="https://grainlinestudio.com/shop/women/archer-button-up-shirt-pdf/">https://grainlinestudio.com/shop/women/archer-button-up-shirt-pdf/</a>. I lengthened this by 4cm and that is definitely too much. I made it following the Archer Sew-along that Jen posted on the Grainline blog which was incredibly helpful and basically the only way a n00b like me could ever have sewn a whole shirt.</p>
