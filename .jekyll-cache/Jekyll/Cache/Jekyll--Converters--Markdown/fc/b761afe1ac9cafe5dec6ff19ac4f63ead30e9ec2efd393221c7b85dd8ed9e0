  <li>As a rule, I donâ€™t read any weeknotes from people I donâ€™t know. Except <a href="https://notes.annagoss.co/">Annaâ€™s</a> which contain things like this:
    <blockquote>
      <p>got wound up by seeing a totally inaccurate use of a reflexive pronoun in some work comms because it just did not need to be there. look at this sharp increase since the 1960s! I donâ€™t know why this bothers me, except I kind of do: pretending to be formal and getting it wrong feels quite closely related to the kind of inauthentic lack of substance that riles me right up. I should be more forgiving, I know.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>This is exactly how I feel about inaccurate reflexive pronouns too! I didnâ€™t know they were called that. People on The Apprentice <em>love</em> using reflexive pronouns when they donâ€™t need them.</li>
  <li>I might actually know Anna. Have we met? She seems like someone I have met but I just canâ€™t remember.</li>
  <li>At the weekends, E usually sleeps from 1:30pm to 5pm, at which point we wake her up. THREE AND A HALF HOURS. Then she gets up, has tea, plays a bit and goes back to bed at 7:30.</li>
</ul>
