  <li>Thirty weeks of weaknotes!</li>
  <li>Happy mother’s day all u mums out there.</li>
  <li>I finished my bird print <a href="/blog/bird-shirt">Kalle shirt</a> this week. I wore it to work. It got quite a few compliments, many of which came from stylish people. I’ve already ordered some more fabric for my next one.</li>
  <li>Like everyone else, I have Brexit fatigue. Funny to think that right now nobody has any idea if we’ll actually end up leaving the EU or not.</li>
  <li>[Alice vs Nature] We have mice again, or at least, some came to visit and did some poos our living room. (NB not the ideal place for pooing)</li>
  <li>That’s it. I could say more about this week but I am choosing bed over writing about things that have happened.</li>
