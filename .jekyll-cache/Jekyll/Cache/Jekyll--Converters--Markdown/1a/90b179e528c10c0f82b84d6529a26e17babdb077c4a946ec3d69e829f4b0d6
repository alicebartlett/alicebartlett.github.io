  <li>Day late with the weaknotes this week, I was a bit busy yesterday.</li>
  <li>This week I went to a conference that the same number of women speaking as there were men named Patrick. Many of the conference talks were very good and I was glad I went, but yeah. Not a good line up.</li>
  <li>It feels bad when you care about doing something difficult well but then still manage to mess it up. Try not to dwell on how bad it feels, or make excuses about how you tried. None of those feelings or excuses are helping you improve the thing you care about.</li>
  <li>I am trying to show E how to smell things, but she thinks I am blowing on them. It is very good to see her gently take a sweet pea, bring it up to her nose and softly, so softly, blow on it.</li>
