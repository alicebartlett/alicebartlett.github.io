I"ÿ<p>I made this <a href="https://www.woolandthegang.com/en/products/ruby-rabbit">Wool and The Gang rabbit</a> for my sister-in-lawâ€™s soon baby.</p>

<p>This is the second time Iâ€™ve made this pattern. The first one, which I made for my now-baby, came out a bit lumpier than this. I added a rattle to this one for added interest.</p>

<p>This pattern is a bit hard to follow for a complete beginner but the second time around it was very quick to knit up. I think I still made quite a lot of mistakes. A third rabbit is probably on the cards tbh.</p>
