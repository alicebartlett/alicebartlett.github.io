I"æ<p><em>[Note] Hello - this is an old post that Iâ€™ve moved over from my Tumblr. Iâ€™ve just copied the words and pictures across.</em></p>

<p>Alice is on my team at work. Weâ€™re both called Alice. It gets a little confusing. I agreed to make her a shirt about 2 months ago, itâ€™s taken me this long to get around to it.</p>

<p>I took a lot of care with sewing this, itâ€™s probably my neatest sewing ever, although my sewing machine appears to be giving up. There are a lot of skipped stitches here where the top thread doesnâ€™t catch the bottom one.</p>

<p>I had to lengthen the pattern by about 5cm for Alice as sheâ€™s quite tall. Itâ€™s tricky not being able to check that the pattern is coming together OK on an actual body, but - probably because Iâ€™ve made this pattern twice before - I knew more or less how it should come together.</p>

<p>Pattern: This is my third <a href="https://grainlinestudio.com/shop/women/archer-button-up-shirt-paper/">Archer</a>. Iâ€™m getting pretty good at these now &lt;:^] Someone (hi Sarah!) asked me where I get my patterns from, well Grainline is the place. I really like the indie pattern scene. As well as always putting out patterns I want to make, Jen from Grainline seems like a big time sweetheart and puts an extraordinary amount of effort into customer support / additional resources.</p>

<p>Fabric: Alice chose this fabric, we bought it on a joint shopping trip to Cloth House on Berwick St. The Buttons are also from Cloth House. The fabric was really easy to work with, and I even french seamed the whole thing so there are no bare fraying edges.</p>
