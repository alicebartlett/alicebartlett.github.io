          <p>To be honest, I probably just broke a URL somewhere or moved something and forgot to update it.</p>
          <p>"But... but... cool URLs don't change!!" you splutter indignantly</p>
          <p>Yeah, I agree but these URLs aren't cool. They were very gifted at flute but gave up playing because they thought they'd get invited to more parties if they stopped. They took up smoking a bit too late. They sometimes make a piggy snort when they laugh. They grew up to be the sort of people who write gnomic blog posts with words like "praxis" in them.</p>
