        <title>Week 38: This week&#39;s least popular word is &#39;automating&#39;</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uh, so satisfying being able to type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;make-week&lt;/code&gt; and just know that my very clever bash script will calculate the date of next Saturday and populate the front matter for my weaknotes. This has given me an idea for automating my post titles too‚Ä¶ [some typing later] ‚Ä¶ OK well if I want to know the least popular word in every weaknote was I‚Äôve now got a script for that‚Ä¶ I could write a commit hook that creates the title every time I commit the weaknote. Would that be good? They‚Äôd probably be a bit rubbish. Can you tell I‚Äôm procrastinating from writing a conference talk?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if I just wrote a commit hook at appended ‚ÄúThis week‚Äôs least popular word was &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù to the end of the weaknote. Would that be fun. That might be fun. SHUT UP AND WRITE YOUR TALK ABSTRACT AB.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I went to the Alresford watercress festival last weekend. It was good - there were lots of dogs for E to look at and she was just incredibly happy to be there which was nice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Alresford I also saw a set of quadruplets, so that‚Äôs something.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I just trod in a lot of dog poo. I was thinking about how dog poo is disgusting, but why is that? It‚Äôs made up of the same atoms that everything else is made up of, including me, so in some ways aren‚Äôt we all dog poo?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More typing happened and now I have some sentiment analysis which generates an emoji with the same sentiment. I‚Äôve looked at the sentiment analysis algorithm and it is‚Ä¶ not very smart.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This week‚Äôs emoji is üò±&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This week‚Äôs least popular word is ‚Äúautomating‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Week 37: (not a typo)</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We did a staycation this week, while E still went to nursery. We were meant to get some big DIY jobs done, but of the three Things To Do, all of them were delayed by something further across the Gantt chart.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt normally listen to This American Life, but a friend pointed me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/674/get-a-spine/act-one-3&quot;&gt;this episode&lt;/a&gt; about Dan Harmon‚Äôs apology to Mengan Ganz, a writer he sexually harassed over two or three years and it is mind blowing. Dan Harmon was the creator and show runner for Community. Over the course of two years he harassed a woman on his staff that he was attracted to and then, when she rejected him, he belittled and humiliated her repeatedly. In the analysis of the apology, we hear about his previous attempts to apologise, which were rubbish, and we hear from the Megan about the impact being harassed had had on her. Listening to this made me feel slightly sick. I know a lot of men who do or have done varying shades of Dan Harmon. They should all listen to this or at the very least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/674/transcript&quot;&gt;read the transcript&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;gt; ‚ÄúThe trick is if you lie to yourself you can lie to everybody. It‚Äôs really easy. And so that‚Äôs what I continued to do, telling myself and anybody that threatened to confront me with it that if you thought what I was doing was creepy or flirty or unprofessional then it‚Äôs because you were the sexist. You were jealous. I was supporting this person. I‚Äôm a mentor, I‚Äôm a feminist.‚Äù
&amp;gt; ‚Äú[After she rejected him] And that was probably the darkest of it all because I drank, I took pills, I crushed on her and resented her for not reciprocating it. And the entire time I was the one writing her pay checks and in control of whether she stayed or went, and whether she felt good about herself or not, and said horrible things. Just treated her cruelly, pointedly. Things that I would never, ever, ever have done if she had been male and if I had never had those feelings for her.‚Äù
&amp;gt; ‚ÄúAnd I never did it before and I will never do it again. But I certainly wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do it if I had any respect for women. On a fundamental level, I was thinking about them as different creatures.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This apology is really good because I think Dan Harmon is actually sorry about what he did and he took a big risk to improve the situation. In his apology he describes in a very clear and straightforward way what he did and why it was bad, he doesn‚Äôt make any excuses but he also doesn‚Äôt wallow in how sorry he is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should go without saying, but clearly doesn‚Äôt because I keep having to say this to people, the point of doing an apology well is to repair the harm you caused another person. It is to help them feel better and move on. If you don‚Äôt think you really caused any harm, and you are not actually sorry, then don‚Äôt apologise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The other thing this made me think of is how annoying being a woman between the ages of 15 and 25 is. When I was younger it was basically impossible to tell which of my male peers were being nice to me because I was a chill yoghurt babe, and who was harbouring a nerd crush on me, which they would reveal to me at some point, in an awkward email, or a weird phone call, tainting every fun memory I had with them in the process. This is kind of the deal for a lot of young women, but it‚Äôs approximately 100 times more pronounced if you do a degree in Computer Science where the ratio of men to women is 80:3 (not a typo).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A talk I gave about Git has been circulated widely on twitter again which is giving me some warm feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am waiting for some babies to be born, it is an exciting time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Tottorri cross Kalle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/bird-shirt&quot;&gt;my last Kalle shirt&lt;/a&gt; I knew I wanted to make another in &lt;a href=&quot;https://merchantandmills.com/store/cloth/tottorri-cross-black/&quot;&gt;this Japanese seersucker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fabric is so delicious. That is all I have to say on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tottorri cross Bantam</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I made this &lt;a href=&quot;https://merchantandmills.com/store/books/the-workbook/&quot;&gt;Bantam vest&lt;/a&gt; about two years ago I think, just before I got pregnant. I can‚Äôt remember why I never got around to photographing it, probably because I had a baby bump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fabric is so nice. It‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://merchantandmills.com/store/cloth/tottorri-cross/&quot;&gt;Japanese seersucker printed with small crosses&lt;/a&gt;. When I first wore this top it was a little stiff but after a few washes it has softened up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this vest pattern, but it‚Äôs too big for me now. Next time I‚Äôll make a smaller size.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 36: t(&#39;_&#39;t)</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hello. Every time I get the week number or date wrong (a side effect of sloppy copy/pasting front matter around) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alicebartlett/alicebartlett.github.io/commit/44069f44fc24495e78c1539677d9e5b3b66a1414#diff-3fac8e9ac51fdc825783e1c6f866d0b7&quot;&gt;Tom Stuart comments on the file on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, which then notifies me via my work email, which I then see on Monday. Anyway. I‚Äôve fixed the problem now because I‚Äôve written a bash script that will generate front matter for whatever the next Saturday is going to be. Thanks for your patience Tom. Please keep sending me corrections via GitHub t(‚Äò_‚Äòt).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did everyone have a good bank holiday? Do people generally talk about how good May is? The weather is picking up, there are two bank holidays, your garden plants are looking good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm off work next week because I haven‚Äôt had a holiday since Christmas. We‚Äôre going to stay around the house and do DIY while poor E goes to nursery and is none the wiser :^]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Week 35: Enjoyable foible</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it was Phil who shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://lrb.co.uk/v40/n18/tom-crewe/here-was-a-plague&quot;&gt;this LRB article about the Aids crisis&lt;/a&gt;. I might just think that because I know Phil reads LRB. Anyway - this article is very comprehensive and beautifully written. It is also absolutely devastating. I was born towards the end of the crisis so although I knew about it growing up I have slightly weird memories of it. There were some things I didn‚Äôt know and had never thought about, like the fact that to begin with nobody knew what it was, and there was no test for it. That at the beginning in the UK everyone thought it was ‚Äúa US thing‚Äù. That there were special AIDS wards full of men just wasting away from the illness. That in 1987 only one funeral home would take Aids deaths. This bit:
&amp;gt; [June 1983, after the publishing a book called ‚ÄúHow To Have Sex In An Epidemic‚Äù] Gonorrhoea diagnoses dropped by 73 per cent in San Francisco and more than halved in New York. It is likely that thousands of HIV infections were averted. But for more than half of all the gay men in both cities it was already too late.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I also learnt the origins of the phrase ‚Äúpatient zero‚Äù. It‚Äôs from a diagram mapping out HIV cases at the time thought to originate from a single air steward, Ga√´tan Dugas. This was possible because Dugas kept names and addresses of the men if different cities that he had slept with. On the diagram he is marked with a letter ‚Äúo‚Äù standing for ‚Äúout of town‚Äù. Although people initially thought Dugas had spread HIV though being extremely promiscuous, it later emerged that the incubation period for HIV was much longer than people thought, meaning the men Dugas had slept with were likely already infected before they met Dugas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I just watched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81080637&quot;&gt;AOC documentary on Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. I cried several times during it. Can‚Äôt really explain why, it was just really moving.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôve settled in to the new office. There are a number of things that I find entertaining about the build out - things that just haven‚Äôt been done quite right that I enjoy noticing but that don‚Äôt bother me. For example, the toilet locks are all at one of two orientations. For some, unlocked points down and locked points at 9pm, and for others, unlocked is at 9pm, and locked is up. I can see how this happens, there were lots of locks to fit and different people did them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The other enjoyable foible of the new building is that the handles are fitted on the wrong side of the revolving doors. The doors revolve in both directions but the way everyone wants to go is anti-clockwise. This would be fine but the handles are fitted for the clockwise direction. Remarkably, they have now put stickers on the doors to encourage people to push the doors anti-clockwise (IN CONTRADICTION TO THE HANDLES!). Sorry. Not interesting but it is true.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is national stationery week! We went on a little lunchtime trip to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.presentandcorrect.com/&quot;&gt;Present and Correct&lt;/a&gt;, which was very good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Week 34: Spritz your bum</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hello everyone. I am feeling a little unsettled this week. I think it‚Äôs because we moved office, but I‚Äôve just not been able get into anything at work. Everything I did just felt like skating over the surface of a problem not properly understanding it and not properly dealing with it. Hopefully next week will be better.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relatedly I am deep &lt;em&gt;deep&lt;/em&gt; into not knowing what is going on with our tech stack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The new office is really nice. They have fizzy water on tap, and Japanese toilets that spritz your bum if you want. Now, when I feel like indulging I can go for a ‚Äúluxury poo‚Äù.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feeling very much like the sort of person that responds to adverts that begin ‚ÄúLife got you down?‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/waysofeating/letters/i-dream-of-canteens&quot;&gt;article about canteens&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aanand&quot;&gt;@aanand&lt;/a&gt; shared via twitter. It‚Äôs great and really captures why I like the Sainsbury‚Äôs caf√© so much. The Sainsbury‚Äôs caf√© isn‚Äôt technically a canteen (and you‚Äôre not allowed to eat your own food there, although the staff don‚Äôt seem to mind if you do) but even on a Saturday lunchtime there is enough space to feel no pressure to move along, and there‚Äôs plenty of different types of seating, and lots of people enjoying a lunch out. I once saw a man throw up on the floor and nobody made a big deal out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I made another Kalle shirt. I‚Äôm going to make a third.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Week 33: Weird flex but ok</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I had a bit of a dicky tum tum this week. I never realised how often you get sick when you have a baby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This was our last week in the current work building. Pretty excited to be moving to the new office. Obviously some of it will be rubbish but I view these kinds of things as boring resilience tests (I‚Äôm serious!). Also - nothing will compare to the suffering of the BERG move from the airy workshop space with skylights (now a WeWork) to the nylon carpet condemned Epworth House on City Road (now some other off-brand co-working space)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I think I might be having an existential cri- oh no sorry my period is due. Never mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have learnt a new put down: ‚ÄúWeird flex but ok‚Äù. You say it when someone is humblebragging about something. You know like this: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the only person at work that uses Linux‚Äù, ‚ÄúWeird flex but ok‚Äù.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have a new favourite Product Manager at work - Matt product manages the FT‚Äôs audio work but is also a PROFESSIONAL BAKER?!?!?! And every so often he brings in left-overs from his Saturday stall at Crystal Palace market. The cakes he brings in are absolutely delicious and totally beautiful. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.brettandbailey.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Brett &amp;amp; Bailey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NEW BEYONC√â!!! She is otherworldly. What a breathtaking performance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I had Thursday off this week with E. My god it was heaven. She was a dream. We went to Mayow Park twice, looked at plants, played shop with the other children in the park, went down the big slide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On Good Friday we went to another park with some other friends, one of who is Edith‚Äôs ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù from nursery. E kept chasing her friend and trying to cuddle her and they appear to have their own language?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Week 32: A lot of Ru Paul&#39;s Drag Race makes sense</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look at this! You‚Äôre now reading this over https. I thought it was going to be annoying to set up and I might have to‚Ä¶ understand DNS or know what an A record is, but actually I only needed to update some IP addresses in Gandi and then check a checkbox in GitHub. This has definitely been made easier for me by the eggheads at GitHub since I last tried to do this so‚Ä¶ well done eggs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[Eco NEWS] I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47161379?fbclid=IwAR2paGhHI1OI__6FNQx9ycRJjMO4sMl55UwyH1IirCDNhX-PctU_5xkRVx0&quot;&gt;this thing&lt;/a&gt; about packaging and now I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm supposed to buy plastic free spinach or bagged spinach. I do feel quite lucky that none of the canvas totes I own have anything smug like &lt;em&gt;I‚Äôm not a plastic bag&lt;/em&gt; written on them but that‚Äôs because all of them came free from tech conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[Wokenotes] Mariko shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/5mYbJswwvpT6veWYM4V30I?si=IfUTm1DTQ6aH3072iNPhcA&quot;&gt;episode of the Reply All podcast&lt;/a&gt; about the origins of ‚Äúyasss!‚Äù which is good. I &lt;em&gt;sort of new&lt;/em&gt; it had queer origins but this podcast has the actual facts. Please can all white people stop saying ‚Äúyasss‚Äù now, thank you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I started watching Pose on iplayer after Nat wrote about it. Two things:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I feel stupid for saying this but finally a lot of Ru Paul‚Äôs Drag Race makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm not sure I can watch any more of it, because I think some of the acting might be bad?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I planted out my sweet peas, and potted on my other cut flowers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fleabag was good wasn‚Äôt it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FFFFFFFFFFFFFF I am so tired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Week 31: More wokenotes than weaknotes</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A lot happened this week! This is going to be more wokenotes than weaknotes honestly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My garden has many tulips in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everytime I go to the florist in Forest Hill there is some diva in there making very precise and exacting demands of the florist who seems very busy and very patient.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/improving-the-fts-engineering-progression&quot;&gt;I wrote up&lt;/a&gt; the first bit of the career progression framework we did for work. People have been really positive about it which is nice. Obviously - we need to maintain momentum to ship the beta version. It‚Äôs so thrilling to be able to work in the open like this, and it‚Äôs basically possible because of the amount of trust the CTO has in us, so that‚Äôs nice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I consumed three good things on the internet this week - two of them shared with me via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annashipman.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Anna Shipman&lt;/a&gt;, who continues to absolutely crush it as my manager.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Firstly this thing in the Harvard Business Review about how women disproportionately volunteer for &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2018/07/why-women-volunteer-for-tasks-that-dont-lead-to-promotions&quot;&gt;‚Äúglue work‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;. Here is what glue work is:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Non-promotable tasks are those that benefit the organization but likely don‚Äôt contribute to someone‚Äôs performance evaluation and career advancement. These tasks include traditional office ‚Äúhousework,‚Äù such as organizing a holiday party, as well as a much wider set of tasks, such as filling in for a colleague, serving on a low-ranking committee, or taking on routine work that doesn‚Äôt require much skill or produce much impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HBR did a couple of studies and were able to conclude that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a mixed-sex group, men will hold back on volunteering while women in turn will volunteer to ensure that the task is done. But in single-sex groups, this changes ‚Äî men and women volunteer equally. In these groups men know they have to step forward if they want to find a volunteer, and women expect other women to volunteer, making them less compelled to do so themselves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This came up because I was asked to go to a workshop to give feedback on something not-very-related to my job and I noticed the guest list for this workshop was nearly all women. I was irked by this because I get asked to do this a lot and I assume partly that happens because I‚Äôm good at giving feedback and that is because I, like all women, have been socialised to be good at giving feedback in a way that isn‚Äôt going to upset the receiver.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anyway, I posted that article about glue work in the team Slack channel and asked the men to have a little think about who was doing the glue work in their teams, and the non-men to have a little think about the things they volunteer for. Credit to my brilliant team - it received quite a lot of positive emoji reactions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second thing Anna shared is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45ey4jgoxeU&quot;&gt;this video about ‚ÄúWhite Fragility‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Robin DiAngelo. I actually watched it once, and then watched it a second time to take notes. I know - where do I find the time. Here are some good bits - but you should watch all of it. These notes are just for me to come back to later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Through my work as a diversity trainer] I could see that [white people] are taught to think of racism as a series of discrete acts rather than a complex interconnected system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We consider a challenge to our [racist] world views as a challenge to our very identities as good, moral people ‚Ä¶ even the smallest amount of racial stress is intolerable, the mere suggestion that being white has meaning often triggers a range of defensive responses such as anger, fear and guilt ‚Ä¶ These responses serve to reinstate the equilibrium as they repel the challenge and return our racial comfort&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I could see the power of the belief that only bad people are racist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A white progressive is any white person that thinks that he or she is not racist or is less racist, or is the choir, or already ‚Äúgets it‚Äù ‚Ä¶ white progressives can be the most difficult people for people of colour to deal with, because to the degree that we think ‚Äúwe have it‚Äù we‚Äôre going to put all our energy into making sure you think we have it and none of it into what we need to be doing for the rest of our lives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Racism is the system we are in, and none of us could be and none of us were exempt from it‚Äôs forces. But the way we‚Äôre taught about racisim fucntions beautifully to not only obscure the system but exempt us from it‚Äôs forces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The most profound message of all - I could call a white neighbourhood good, I could call a school filled with white teachers and white children a good school, the fundamental message is that there is no inherent value in the perspectives of experiences of people of colour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think when we [women] don‚Äôt back people of colour, the betrayal is deeper, because we have a potential way in [to understanding] and so often we use it as a way out ‚Ä¶ our resentment about sexism can cause us to not back people of colour and actually collude with the benefits of whiteness to get a little bit ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;what has allowed you to remain ignorant about how to interrupt racism in 2018?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The antidote to guilt is action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Feedback from people of colour [on how you have caused them pain] indicates trust because it is a huge moment of risk across a deep history of harm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And one last wokenote: My cute friend Mariko shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yzMUs3badc&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; about why some Asian accents swap L and R sounds. It is very interesting and (mercifully) quite short.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
