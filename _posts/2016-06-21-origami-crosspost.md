It's been eight months since I joined the Financial Times to work on their components system, Origami. I'm the tech lead, or platform head, depending on what end of the telescope you're looking down. Is that the right metaphor? Who knows.

I prefer "tech lead" but that doesn't cover some of the other things I have to do in the role which are less about tech decisions and more about reporting upwards.

Anyway. This post isn't about that. It's to say that [I've written a blog post about Origami](http://engineroom.ft.com/2016/06/20/origami-and-177-ft-sites/) over on the Financial Times' tech blog. There will be some more posts in the future about what we're doing with Origami and why, but first I needed to lay some ground-work about the Financial Times.

If you're working on something similar, especially if you're working in publishing, I'd love to hear from you.
