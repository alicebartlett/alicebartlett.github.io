* The Covid19 test arrived on Monday. It had to be posted at exactly 4:30pm in a specific post box. This gave me an excellent idea for guessing how many people around me think they might have corona virus. Post box stakeout!
* As other people have said - it is quite complicated. As nobody has said, it is pretty difficult to get a swab from a 2 year old. They have very small noses and are not compliant.
* This week, the Tom Hanks movie we watched was The Post. L's review: "This has a lot of actors in it doesn't it" (yes). It has that man from The West Wing in it.
* Balls-deep-in-tomatoes rating: Mid calf.
* I made a really really good raspberry ice cream. It's from the Ben and Jerry's ice cream book. The other ice creams we've made have been pretty good, but this is the first one that's been better than something I could have bought in a shop. Did you know that Ben off of Ben and Jerry is anosmic, which is why their ice cream has so many chunky bits in it - so that Ben can tell what the flavour is.
* Whoops. I've gone and published these a 6 days early. Ah well - stop by on Saturday for the completed version ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
