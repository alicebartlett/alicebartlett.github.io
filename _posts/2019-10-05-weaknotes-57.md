* Somebody said "coffee can" and I was reminded that my dad gave me one of these once: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OID4sxCfie8. He did that because either he invented the heating mechanism or his friend did. I have forgotten. Anyway - I think the coffee was probably disgusting, but I'd like to try it now.
* This week I've been listening to John Adams Ear Box at work while working. Let me tell you have been fighting the sapiosexuals off with a stick, it has been a nightmare.
* This week a lot of things happened. Eventually so many things that I just let them all wash over me in the hopes that later I'd be able to come up for air having not forgotten anything.
* Q4 baby!
* My granny (93?) has gone into a home. Any tips for nice things to do for people who go into homes? Except parade her great grandaughter around of course. There'll be plenty of that. Anyway. Email me.
* List of things I need before I can do any proper work:
- Water
- External monitors exactly even with each other
- Empty bladder
- Hands moisturised but not too moisturised
* I have over moisturised my hands
* When I was little we had a childminder called sue who always had slimy over moisturised hands and sparkly bubblegum pink nail varnish. My brother and I didnâ€™t like her but she did have a NES and flower print toilet paper which I was obsessed with.
