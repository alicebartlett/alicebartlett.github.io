* I was trying to say "some people just want to watch the world burn", but it came out "some people just want to watch the world bone."
* This week in politics: scuse the french but - what the le fuck?
* Ooh I fancy a croissant.
* I watched the supreme court ruling live on a massive telly at work with some other people. I got butterflies.
* I went to a spa in Bath this weekend, which is why these notes are late. Well they're also late because I've started knitting a jumper for E and I'm obsessed with it so I'm doing that instead of typing.
* Thanks for the emails about age of empires. Shout out to the RSS massive.
