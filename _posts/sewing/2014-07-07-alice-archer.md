_[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I've moved over from my Tumblr. I've just copied the words and pictures across._

Alice is on my team at work. We’re both called Alice. It gets a little confusing. I agreed to make her a shirt about 2 months ago, it’s taken me this long to get around to it.

I took a lot of care with sewing this, it’s probably my neatest sewing ever, although my sewing machine appears to be giving up. There are a lot of skipped stitches here where the top thread doesn’t catch the bottom one.

I had to lengthen the pattern by about 5cm for Alice as she’s quite tall. It’s tricky not being able to check that the pattern is coming together OK on an actual body, but - probably because I’ve made this pattern twice before - I knew more or less how it should come together.

Pattern: This is my third [Archer](https://grainlinestudio.com/shop/women/archer-button-up-shirt-paper/). I’m getting pretty good at these now <:^] Someone (hi Sarah!) asked me where I get my patterns from, well Grainline is the place. I really like the indie pattern scene. As well as always putting out patterns I want to make, Jen from Grainline seems like a big time sweetheart and puts an extraordinary amount of effort into customer support / additional resources.

Fabric: Alice chose this fabric, we bought it on a joint shopping trip to Cloth House on Berwick St. The Buttons are also from Cloth House. The fabric was really easy to work with, and I even french seamed the whole thing so there are no bare fraying edges.
