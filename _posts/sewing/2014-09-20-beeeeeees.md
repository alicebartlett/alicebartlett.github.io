_[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I've moved over from my Tumblr. I've just copied the words and pictures across._

BEEEEEEEEEES

For my good friend Helen’s birthday I made her a shirt. It’s an Archer, of course. I don’t have a picture of her wearing it, unfortunately. ALL I have are these three hastily snapped photos.

Helen chose the bee print while she was in London and I think it is SO CUTE. The fabric is from McCulloch and Wallis.
