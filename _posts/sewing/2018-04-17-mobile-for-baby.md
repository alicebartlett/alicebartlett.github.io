_[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I've moved over from my Tumblr. I've just copied the words and pictures across._

I made a mobile for my daughter.

I thought I might have made a bit of an error by making a boring and tasteful mobile which she would hate but actually she loves it and loves lying underneath it watching the fishes swim around.

The pattern is Yumiko Higuchiâ€™s fish from her book Zakka Embroidery.
