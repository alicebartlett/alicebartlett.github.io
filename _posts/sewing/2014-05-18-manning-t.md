_[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I've moved over from my Tumblr. I've just copied the words and pictures across._

Fabric: Liberty “Manning” bought from Raystitch ([http://www.raystitch.co.uk/fabric/lighter-weight-fabrics-lawn-and-voile/liberty-tana-lawn-6.html](http://www.raystitch.co.uk/fabric/lighter-weight-fabrics-lawn-and-voile/liberty-tana-lawn-6.html)) I’m madly in love with this fabric.

Pattern: [http://shop.grainlinestudio.com/product/scout-woven-tee](http://shop.grainlinestudio.com/product/scout-woven-tee). Lengthened this by 1 inch and I’m pretty sure it’s the perfect length for me. I also lengthened the sleeves by about an inch, and I prefer them to the pattern length which always seem a little short.
