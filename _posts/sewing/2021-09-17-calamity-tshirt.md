Still trying to find a good place to take photos... Here I am trying out the garden. I should get a tripod but instead I have to search around for things to balance my camera on like an idiot.

This is the Merchant and Mills T-shirt in a linen called Calamity Blue. It has no side-shaping at all, it is a straight tshirt. I think _maybe_ this would be better on me if it did have some shaping. Unfortunatley this is too big across the shoulders which is far to much effort for me to change.

I really like the combination of the ribbing and the linen. It just think looks really cool!
