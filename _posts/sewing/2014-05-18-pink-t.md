_[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I've moved over from my Tumblr. I've just copied the words and pictures across._

Fabric: Both of these are jerseys from the basement of Cloth House (98 Berwick St)

Pattern: [https://grainlinestudio.com/shop/women/scout-tee-paper/](https://grainlinestudio.com/shop/women/scout-tee-paper/). I used the full back pattern mod that Jen blogged here: [https://grainlinestudio.com/2011/11/15/pattern-tutorial-scout-full-back-pattern/](https://grainlinestudio.com/2011/11/15/pattern-tutorial-scout-full-back-pattern/). I lengthened this by 2cm but I should probably have lengthened it more as the swingy mod makes the whole pattern a bit short.

I really like the colours of the pocket and t-shirt but the pocket fabric is too heavy for the body fabric, really.

The pocket was quite difficult to sew and you only get one go at sewing it as the seam allowance around the edge of  slit is so little that the trauma of unpicking would fuzz up the edges too much to have a decent shot at a second attempt.
