Many moons ago, when I had a young face as evidenced in the photo at the bottom of this post, I made a [TN31 Parka](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/tn31-parka). I wore it loads in the 6 years since I made it. A wardrobe staple, but it had started to look a little ropey, in particular the neck ribbing which had stretched out a lot.

One of the injuries sustained to my parka was when I was pregnant with my second child I threw up in an alleyway with such force that I ripped open the lowest buttonhole.

That foetus is now 4 years old and in need of a new coat. Luckily the TN31 has plenty of fabric that can be lovingly repurposed for a quilted jacket for a small guy.

Behold! The Barboursaurus Jacket!

The pattern is the [Fibre Mood](https://thefoldline.com/products/fibre-mood-child-teen-bobby-jacket) pattern with some added spikes.

The fabric is bits of my old TN31 and some scraps from other sewing projects.

C loves the coat - it has plenty of room for his toy cars in both pockets.

Because I've reused the fabric, it has a lovely patina to it.
