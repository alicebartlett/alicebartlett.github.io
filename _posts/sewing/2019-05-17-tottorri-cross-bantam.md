I made this [Bantam vest](https://merchantandmills.com/store/books/the-workbook/) about two years ago I think, just before I got pregnant. I can't remember why I never got around to photographing it, probably because I had a baby bump.

This fabric is so nice. It's [Japanese seersucker printed with small crosses](https://merchantandmills.com/store/cloth/tottorri-cross/). When I first wore this top it was a little stiff but after a few washes it has softened up.

I love this vest pattern, but it's too big for me now. Next time I'll make a smaller size.
