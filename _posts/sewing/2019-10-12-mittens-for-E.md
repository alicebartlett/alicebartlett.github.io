Following on from the mittens I made for myself, I made some for E. It remains to be seen how much she'll wear them but so far she is a big fan of taking them on and off.

Once again, I made the pattern up using parts from Mary Scott Huff's book ["The Mitten Handbook"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34227579-the-mitten-handbook).

Rather than following a pattern I just traced around E's hand and knitted something accordingly.
