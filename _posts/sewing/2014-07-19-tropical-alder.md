_[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I've moved over from my Tumblr. I've just copied the words and pictures across._

It’s so damn hot today. The kind of heat I try to imagine through the winter but can’t. The kind of heat where I avoid watching telly because it will make the room hotter and it’s already so hot that I’m stuck to the sofa. Lucky for me I have just finished Grainline’s latest pattern, the [Alder Shirtdress](https://grainlinestudio.com/shop/women/dresses/alder-shirtdress-paper/). This was a joy to sew. All the fun of a shirt but without having to bother with setting sleeves and sewing plackets, neither of which I’m very good at.

For some reason I goofed somewhere along the way and, when I had finished sewing, the front was about an inch shorter than the back. Either I added the bust darts incorrectly or the back piece of the pattern moved when I was tracing it making it longer than it should have been. Jen is going to do a sew-along for this on the Grainline blog so I’ll be paying close attention to the darts day to figure this out.

Pattern I cut a straight size 14/US 10. The horror of sewing a dress for the first time is realising my measurements span 4 different dress sizes. I picked the middle-ish size rather than bothering with altering the pattern to fit me across all of them, though I might try that for future versions. As usual for Grainline this pattern has a lot of room to move around in so I needn’t have worried about it being too small across the hips. Unusually for me, I didn’t bother lengthening this pattern. Since it’s for summer I figured it’s fine if it comes up a bit short.

Fabric I bought this fabric from [Minerva](https://www.minervacrafts.com/shop/fabric/dress-fabrics) crafts after hearing about them from Yes I like that. It’s a medium weight printed stretch cotton, pretty easy to sew although I did break TWO sewing machine needles on this project. It was £12 a metre which seems like a pretty good deal to me. I had a quick google to see what other people are making with this fabric and came across this [beautiful dress](http://underalteration.blogspot.com/2014/02/gorgeous-georgia.html).

The buttons are from The Cloth House on Berwick St. They are clearly really cheaply made (there are lots of weird swirls and seams from a very quick injection molding process) but I think the cheapness is a pretty good match for this fabric.

I’m very excited to see some other Alder shirt-dresses make it into the wild, I already have my second one planned.
