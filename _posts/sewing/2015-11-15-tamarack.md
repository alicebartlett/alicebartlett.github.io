_[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I've moved over from my Tumblr. I've just copied the words and pictures across._

Two posts in a week! Lucky you! This is the Tamarack jacket from Butt Kitchen favourite: Grainline. This jacket is very simple to construct with a few slightly more advanced techniques like quilting, bias binding and welt pockets thrown in.

Normally I lengthen patterns by a few cm, but this time I didn’t bother, and just cut a straight size UK 14 without alterations.

Because I’m extremely lazy I bought some quilted fabric from [Miss Matabi’s store](https://shop.missmatatabi.com/). It’s fleece on one side and polyester on the other.

The over-all effect of using this type of fabric for this project is the jacket has turned out a bit… dog walker-y? Like I’m about to take the terriers out for a romp across the common you know?

Here’s a photo of me mean mugging in a gritty urban setting to offset the rural vibe of this jacket, anyway.

Although in photos this fabric is navy, in real life it’s a blue-y green colour which is really beautiful.

I accidentally used the wrong width binding, which is a bit annoying but I’m not sure most people would notice unless they’d seen the pattern. Also, as you can see, some of the binding is a bit wonky because it was such a fiddle to sew with.

I’m really pleased with the pockets. Jen’s instructions for sewing them were really clear and straightforward and these are by far the neatest welt pockets I’ve ever managed. I lined them with some leftover fabric from a shirt I made for a friend earlier in the year.

Overall, this was a fun project and I now have a warm-ish “transitional” coat. There are some other quite nice versions of this coat [showing up on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/tamarackjacket/) that you might want to check out.
