I made this [Wool and The Gang rabbit](https://www.woolandthegang.com/en/products/ruby-rabbit) for my sister-in-law's soon baby.

This is the second time I've made this pattern. The first one, which I made for my now-baby, came out a bit lumpier than this. I added a rattle to this one for added interest.

This pattern is a bit hard to follow for a complete beginner but the second time around it was very quick to knit up. I think I still made quite a lot of mistakes. A third rabbit is probably on the cards tbh.
