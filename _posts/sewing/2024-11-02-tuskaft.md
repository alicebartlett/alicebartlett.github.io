I am so behind on writing up things I've sewn or stitched. Might just... not bother? It's the photo editing I can't really stand.

Anyway. This is a tuksaft vest from Pom Pom (RIP). The main thing to say about this is that I really like the yarn, which is De Rerum Natura Ulysse. It feels a bit rough but not itchy, and I am a real princess about itchy knits.

This is the first intarsia knitting I've done. I didn't enjoy it. Not in the way that got better as I got better at doing it, it is simply an unpleasant way to knit.

The neck and shoulders are a bit amateur on mine, but looking at everyone else on Ravelry, theirs look a bit crap too so, just a difficult thing get right I guess.
