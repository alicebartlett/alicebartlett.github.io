* Hello. Every time I get the week number or date wrong (a side effect of sloppy copy/pasting front matter around) [Tom Stuart comments on the file on GitHub](https://github.com/alicebartlett/alicebartlett.github.io/commit/44069f44fc24495e78c1539677d9e5b3b66a1414#diff-3fac8e9ac51fdc825783e1c6f866d0b7), which then notifies me via my work email, which I then see on Monday. Anyway. I've fixed the problem now because I've written a bash script that will generate front matter for whatever the next Saturday is going to be. Thanks for your patience Tom. Please keep sending me corrections via GitHub t('\_'t).
* Did everyone have a good bank holiday? Do people generally talk about how good May is? The weather is picking up, there are two bank holidays, your garden plants are looking good.
* I'm off work next week because I haven't had a holiday since Christmas. We're going to stay around the house and do DIY while poor E goes to nursery and is none the wiser :^]
