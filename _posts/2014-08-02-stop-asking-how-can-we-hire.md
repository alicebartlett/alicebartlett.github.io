An employee of a multi-national tech company, and person who I like a lot, asked me: &ldquo;How can we hire more women?&rdquo;. You know how it goes, I gave an OK answer and then three months later realised I had a better one. The answer I gave was along the lines of:

>&ldquo;listen to marginalised voices, activists and experts in this area, you&rsquo;re going to want to interject when people tell you about their experiences &mdash;to tell them &ldquo;not all men&rdquo;&mdash; but it&rsquo;s important that you don&rsquo;t. Eventually you&rsquo;ll find you know things you didn&rsquo;t know before, and when you know those things, you&rsquo;ll know what to do. There are no easy answers, there is no panacea.&rdquo;


Anyways, I was thinking about this a bit more, wondering about the original question, and it struck me that actually &ldquo;how can we hire more women&rdquo; is bullshit. It&rsquo;s completely the wrong question to ask. &ldquo;How can we hire more women?&rdquo; is a question you ask because you understand that adding women (or any diversity for that matter) to your company will make it stronger[^1].


As someone outside of your company I don&rsquo;t give a flying fuck if it needs me or people like me to be better itself. That&rsquo;s your problem. My problem is that we exist within a system where systemic inequality benefits some people more than others. That system is *unfair*. It means that if you have a foreign sounding name you&rsquo;re less likely to get a callback for a job interview[^2]. It means that people think hiring women for a startup is &ldquo;risky because they might get pregnant&rdquo;[^3]. It means that people who speak out about this are subject to abuse and harassment and a lot of other shit that they don&rsquo;t deserve[^4].


Hiring women and minorities &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s good for a business&rdquo; is the line you give to people who are so uninterested in making the world better for anyone but themselves that it&rsquo;s all you have. They don&rsquo;t care to educate themselves about inequality or don&rsquo;t believe it exists. It&rsquo;s a lever you use on the bad people to convince them to support this cause, a cause you care about because you care about fairness, but they don&rsquo;t because they are terrible humans. It&rsquo;s a last resort for winning over the gaping assholes whose support you need.


You&rsquo;re good people, you care about fairness. Show it by not asking &ldquo;how can we hire more women?&rdquo; but &ldquo;how can we make things better for everyone?&rdquo;

[^1]:OK, yeah, some people ask this because they have a sense that something is wrong in the industry, something they see in the demographics of their company and would like to fix. That&rsquo;s cool, I like those people. I know they aren&rsquo;t acting out of self-interest, but asking &ldquo;How can we hire more women&rdquo; should be the first thought they have which they rapidly bin in favour of &ldquo;How can I make things better for everyone?&rdquo;. My major beef here is with people who treat women as the secret sauce that&rsquo;s going to fix their company and make their lives easier. Cool story: if you&rsquo;re looking at fairness from a wider perspective than just how it benefits you then you don&rsquo;t need to ask &ldquo;How can we hire more women&rdquo; because women will see that you&rsquo;re someone who cares about equality and come to your company _anyway_.
