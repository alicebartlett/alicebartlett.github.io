Dan Williams [had an incredible 2014](http://www.iamdanw.com/wrote/yearnote-2014/) and, reading his, I was (1) massively impressed and (2) inspired to do my own. I've stolen his format and everything.

2014 was the year I became a [front-end developer at the Government Digital Service](#work). I set up this [blog](#bloggering). I started [Tampon Club](#tampon-club), and 2 new [Tumblrs](#tumblrs). I took a really good [holiday](#holiday). I did a bit of [public speaking](#public-speaking) and I was on [telly](#and-finally).

## Work
I joined GDS in January. It's going pretty good. Since joining I've:

- made about 700 contributions to government repositories
- started line managing juniors
- co-run weekly frontend meetings for GDS frontend developers
- MC'd the GDS Christmas all-hands
- written a [blog post for the GDS tech blog](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/08/14/improving-accessibility-on-gov-uk-search/) about accessibility on GOV.UK
- Helped interview developers for three different sets of developer interviews
- started mentoring a colleague

### Things I've failed at
I have to write this here because that list makes me sound like I'm kind of full of myself. I definitely did fuck some stuff up this year too. I made a list of cockups and looking at them the general theme is giving up too soon on things/people/opportunities when stuff became hard or I got too busy. I should probably say yes to fewer things. The other bad thing I did this year was type a password into a public channel by accident _twice_. Both times this was swiftly resolved, but gosh, it's embarrassing when that happens.


## Bloggering
This year I started a blog. You're reading it. I built it myself and it's... fine? Laughably simple, but you can see all these words so I guess it works. The good thing about blogs is that when you have one you can write stuff without needing to set up a blog first. The bad thing about blogs is that the you end up with a drafts folder full of things you gave up on because they turned out to be hard to explain. Here are the titles of my unpublished folder right now:

- Accessibility _-this is a post about how accessibility is sort of like a cake_
- Select tags writeup _-this is a post of a writeup of a talk. Its really long_
- Tampon club for dudes _-this is a post about what to do if you're a dude and you care about Tampon Club_

Anyway, two of those will get published one day. One probably won't.

## Tampon Club

Another thing I did this year was founding Tampon Club. It has a [website](http://tampon.club). People have written things about it:

- [Vice](http://www.vice.com/read/meet-the-woman-who-wants-you-to-fill-your-office-bogs-with-free-tampons-873)

I was also asked onto BBC Radio 5 Live's breakfast show to talk about it. The audio for that is [here on my Tumblr.](http://butt.kitchen/post/104591582049/i-went-on-bbc-radio-5-lives-breakfast-show-this)

## Tumblrs
I started two new tumblrs:

- one for my nail art [nails.butt.kitchen](http://nails.butt.kitchen)
- one for my sewing [sewing.butt.kitchen](http://sewing.butt.kitchen). I sewed 14 things this year; 2 kindle cases, 6 shirts, 3 t-shirts one shirt-dress, one vest, and one quilt. I also abandoned 1 dress, 1 vest, 1 shirt, 1 playsuit and one shirt-dress because I screwed them up beyond repair :(

## Holiday
I went on a cracking holiday with Lachie. We did an american road trip from Denver to Vegas.

It was beautiful!

## Public speaking
I gave three talks this year and was on one panel:

- Five facts about smell- the lightning talk at LRUG -[Video](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5050-five-facts-about-smell)
- Edge 3- the future of the web -[Video](https://edgeconf.com/2014-london?v=6u03xYkwMVI)
- Dump your <select><option>select</option></select> tags - Nightly Build in Cologne
- Dump your <select><option>select</option></select> tags - Epic FEL. -[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUkMCQR4TpY)

## And finally
I was on the Alan Titchmarsh TV show back in February for a feature about nail art. I took a colleague on with me, Amy, and we had a reeeeally fun time. Live telly is quite good. Here is the video. I'm clearly petrified.
