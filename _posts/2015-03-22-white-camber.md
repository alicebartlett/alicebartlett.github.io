_[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I've moved over from my Tumblr. I've just copied the words and pictures across._

Now for something a little more refined after the tropical trouser situation in the previous post. This is the [Camber Top from Merchant and Mills](https://merchantandmills.com/store/patterns/the-camber-set/). It’s not at all obvious from any of these photographs, but I love it!

## Pattern
I cut a size 12, which is smaller than I’d normally cut, but Merchant and Mills patterns have a lot of ease so I figured it would be fine. It fits me ok around the torso but I think I’d prefer a bit more room in the shoulders. Next time I make this pattern I’ll lengthen the shoulder seams I think.

## Fabric
The material is this [criss-cross handloom cotton](https://merchantandmills.com/products/cotton/handloom-criss-cross-cotton/), also from Merchant and Mills. I think it’s quite lovely. I’m not normally someone who can wear white without immediately spilling something on myself, so this is a bold and unprecedented sartorial move for me. Yeah you heard me.
