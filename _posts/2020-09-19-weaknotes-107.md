* This week we went to Norfolk to stay in a holiday cottage with my parents. We hired biked and popped baby C's car seat in a trailer buggy and then the 6 of us pootled along empty country lanes to various beaches. I ate so many blackberries I got a bit of a dicky tummy.
* In the delightful seaside town of Sheringham, I saw a man wearing a "The pandemic is a hoax" t-shirt. Firstly: big energy there my dude, real commitment to your particular corner of the internet to wear that out of the house. Secondly: sorry for being a nerd but what font is that? It's like 2000 bar-cum-nightclub vibe. Is it the font they used on a Hear'say album cover? Sort of Lucida Sans-y... very rounded lower case 'e's. Very thin. It's going to bother me.
* We all have a cold. Patient zero was, as usual, E. She will have caught it from someone at nursery who will have caught it from someone at school. It hasn't (thankfully) presented with any of the covid symptoms, just a runny nose. Our friend's son needed a test recently and couldn't get one until one of them pulled some strings with the hospital he works at. All the take home kits were unavailable, and all the drive through centres were full.
* This holiday my mum kept calling my daughter by my name by accident. Weirdly this was only when E was being naughty? My dad also said "Come here *now* or I'm going to be very cross" which gave me a very vivid flashback.
* We went to Houghton Hall to see the Anish Kapoor Art. I don't want to let anyone down by stating that I am for, against or on the fence about Art as I know some of you will be in opposition whatever I say. Instead simply project your own feelings about modern art onto me.
* I'm not used to seeing so many boomers in one place.
* I took a photo of Lachie in front of some vanta black and it was such a bad shot and Lachie rinsed me so thoroughly that I had to get on the floor to howl with laughter. Last time I laughed so hard was in January when we got a panicked support request from editorial stating that they had published a story with the typo "pubic servant" rather than "public servant" and for some reason they couldn't fix it themselves.
* [This blog post about getting the passport number etc of Tony Abbott via his Instagram post is really well written and interesting](https://mango.pdf.zone/finding-former-australian-prime-minister-tony-abbotts-passport-number-on-instagram)
* Not sure how I came across [@tessplease](https://twitter.com/tessplease) but her series of sketches about JK Rowling's publicist are so funny (see them here: [1](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBTflIiAKVk/?hl=en), [2](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCB3LZ2p9nB/?hl=en), [3](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCT0rD2JIPK/?hl=en), [4](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFKj89hJKEs/?hl=en))
* We have an electric car, and at a charging point at Morrisons a man in his 60's (I guess?) came to talk to me about it. He was very nice but mainly just wanted to tell me how much he didn't fancy having to log in to a website to pay to charge the car because it "sounds complicated". These websites are all a bit shit at the moment. I didn't want to say that to him - yes, I build websites and _even for someone like me_ these sites are complicated, because they are bad. The thing I did say, is that the infrastructure for electric cars is gradually improving, and the choice to buy an electric car is just the point at which the inconvenience is low enough for your circumstances.
* E likes to take photos with my camera, she likes to use my phone too but finds the mechanical button on my Lumix GF1 easier to use. Of course none of these photos are technically very good but I like them because it's like looking into her world to the things she thinks are interesting from her (2ft tall) perspective. Here are a selection from this week:
