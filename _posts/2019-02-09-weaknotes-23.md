* I read [this about pathological liar and author Dan Mallory](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions) after Dan W tweeted it. I didn't really want to be reading it, but it sucked me in. I went to school with a pathological liar but she's probably grown out of it by now. She used to make up all kinds of odd things - her dad (a GP) was being hounded by the press because of some scandal; she wrote a piece of music herself that I recognised to be the Moonlight Sonata ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è; one day she came to school and pretended for a whole day to have lost her voice.
* There are new emoji. Very excited for the flamingo. Not so excited for the small dick emoji.
* I've started a sewing class at Sew Over It. I'm going to make some chroma-key cigarette pants. The new Sew Over It shop is lovely and spacious and bright. I've got the same brilliant teacher that I had last time (Julie). She's basically a pattern savant - can look at any bum/thigh/crotch and say what changes to the pattern need to be made.
* We started watching that Bill Clinton docu on Channel 4. It's good! There is some very eighties hair happening.
* This week edited a hunk for the first time using git. I felt very alive and very powerful to be honest.
* [Chris Noth watch] OMG Chris Noth is in Catastrophe and he has white hair and a moustache!
