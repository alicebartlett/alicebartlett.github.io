_[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I've moved over from my Tumblr. I've just copied the words and pictures across._

A really long time ago I won a competition that [http://www.hannahinthehouse.com](http://www.hannahinthehouse.com) was running, and the prize was some fabric from Liberty.

Well… it’s been about 6 months but I have FINALLY made something worth showing with that fabric.

When I was making a Kindle case for my mum, I knew this grey and green and blue ditzy floral would be perfect for the lining.

The exterior is made from old quilting scraps from a quilt I still haven’t finished in spite of starting it about a year ago (isn’t that always the way with quilts).

I’m so pleased with the end result. Thank you Hannah and Liberty for the fabric!
