The blog posts will continue until morale improves.

Just to say that I've twiddled some dials and updated my local version of ruby so that the weaknotes crowd and the sewing crowd can subscribe to their own RSS feeds and not be bothered by one another.

There's also a category called "kitchen-drawer" which is where all the bits and bobs go - the blog posts about computers, tampon club, flickr, dead batteries, an odd sock, the key which you've forgotten what it's for but it's probably important etc etc.

There's even a yearnotes RSS if you really only want an annual dose of my writing (not sure who those people are in reality but I like the idea of being in that category for someone)

The feed you're reading this on is the everything feed, so if you are happy with what is currently happening then take no action!

Those feeds again:
* [Everything](/feed.xml)
* [Weaknotes](/feed/weaknotes)
* [Yearnotes](/feed/yearnotes)
* [Sewing](/feed/sewing)
* [Kitchen drawer](/feed/kitchen-drawer)
