_[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I've moved over from my Tumblr. I've just copied the words and pictures across._

New kindle case! This is made with some Japanese cotton, and I’ve embroidered two zebras on it from [Yumiko Higuchi’s book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/cka/Zakka-Embroidery-Simple-Two-Color-Motifs-Small-Crafts/1611803101/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1488125851&sr=1-1).
