For my 30th birthday I decided to learn how to knit. I did some knitting, a jumper for E, which turned out OK if a bit wonky, and a jumper for me which turned out bad. Then I stopped knitting for a bit. These mittens are the first new thing I've made since then. I used Wool And The Gang's sugar baby alpaca wool.

I made the pattern up using parts from Mary Scott Huff's book ["The Mitten Handbook"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34227579-the-mitten-handbook).

Mitten knitting is great - lots of opportunity to customise different aspects, plenty of new techniques, quick to finish. Obviously mittens are very chic too. I also have very big hands, so it's thrilling to be able to knit something big enough to accommodate them.

Some technical details for next time:

1. Nordic cast on
1. 50 sts twisted rib
1. Increase to 60 sts
1. 4 sts stockinette
1. western gusset thumb until 21 sts
1. 60 rows stockinette (? I actually can't remember if this is right and I'm too lazy to count. Future me - you may want to count!)
