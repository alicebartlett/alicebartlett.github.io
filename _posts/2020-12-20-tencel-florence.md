Back in March before... all this... I went to Rye with Nat. It was a lovely day. I was 5 month pregnant and we mostly went to the Merchant and Mills shop and tried to work out how long we could leave it between eating things.

On that trip I bought some [tencel twill](https://merchantandmills.com/store/cloth/sustainable/tencel/tencel-twill-aperitivo/). It has the most lovely drape. It feels very luxurious.

I made another Florence top, but of course I was quite pregnant by the time I finished it. So here we are now, in December, I've finally gotten around to photographing it.
