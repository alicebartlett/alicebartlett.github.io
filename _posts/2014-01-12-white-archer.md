_[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I've moved over from my Tumblr. I've just copied the words and pictures across._

Fabric: This is a cross-weave from Cloth House (47 Berwick st). It’s possibly a bit see-through and because it’s cross-weave it washes funny and always needs a good iron.

Pattern: [https://grainlinestudio.com/shop/women/archer-button-up-shirt-pdf/](https://grainlinestudio.com/shop/women/archer-button-up-shirt-pdf/). I lengthened this by 4cm and that is definitely too much. I made it following the Archer Sew-along that Jen posted on the Grainline blog which was incredibly helpful and basically the only way a n00b like me could ever have sewn a whole shirt.
