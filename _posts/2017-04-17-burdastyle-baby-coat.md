_[Note] Hello - this is an old post that I've moved over from my Tumblr. I've just copied the words and pictures across._

A coat for a baby! It’s the [Quilted Baby Coat from BurdaStyle](https://www.burdastyle.com/pattern_store/patterns/quilted-baby-coat-092013). I’m really so proud of how this coat turned out. It’s beautiful!

I made it using some Kokka Painted Canvas from the offcuts bin in Cloth House. It (and some other colour-ways too) are still available from [Ray Stitch](https://raystitch.co.uk/products/fabric/japanese-fabrics).

The adorable bunny lining is also from Cloth House, you can buy it online here from [Macculoch & Wallis](https://www.macculloch-wallis.co.uk/p/21092/quilting-prints/mw/japanese-rabbits).

For the sleeves I used some soft brushed cotton from [Ray Stitch](https://raystitch.co.uk).

The pattern was very straightforward. The only changes I made were switching out the buttons for poppers, and using a woven fabric rather than a knitted fabric.

I’m sure I’ll be making more of these in the future.
