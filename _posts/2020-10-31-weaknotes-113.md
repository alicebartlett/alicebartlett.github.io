* This week, because E was home from nursery, I looked after both kids by myself during the day for five days in a row. And because E was isolating, we couldn't leave the house. I know, I know, is this the single most courageous and extraordinary act in human history? I will let the public decide.
* I am locked in a battle of will with my two and a half year old over who is in charge. She thinks it's her, and I think it's her most of the time but a line must be drawn at her watching "TeeBee" all day, drawing by holding the felt tip up her nose, and doing something I call "getting into things" which is just her pulling things apart (books, clothes, plants).
* This week I made [banana bread](https://thehappyfoodie.co.uk/recipes/banana-loaf) because we had some old bananas, [more chutney](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/oct/04/nigel-slater-green-tomato-recipes)(Nigel Slater this time) to deal with the green tomatoes and [play dough](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/playdough-recipe)(coloured with "[the world's pinkest pink pigment](https://culturehustle.com/products/pink-50g-powdered-paint-by-stuart-semple?variant=26678016329&currency=GBP&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_campaign=gs-2019-02-24&utm_source=google&utm_medium=smart_campaign&gclid=Cj0KCQjw59n8BRD2ARIsAAmgPmJol_IBJs9lLAp7LLFrtBQOF3CABlnqmldI1-C9EWpvbtsdINW5pfgaAinkEALw_wcB)" rather than food colouring) and [salt dough](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-make-salt-dough-recipe) Christmas tree decorations.
* E had a slightly suspicious cough which we thought amounted to "continuous" so we took her for a test on Monday, and as of Friday night, we still don't have any results back. [update] just phoned the test people and after ~20 mins on the phone they said they had lost the test and would launch an investigation. lol ok. E's symptoms are fine again.
* I managed to get an hour on my bike last weekend. Hoping for another hour this weekend.
