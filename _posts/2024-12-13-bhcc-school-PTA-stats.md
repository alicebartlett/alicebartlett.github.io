Hello, ages ago I started thinking about PTA fundraising, and how if you go to a school where the parents all have a lot of spare cash, and worked in professions where the experiences are transferrable into running a fundraising organisation, then your PTA would be able to raise loads of money and you'd probably have some extra nice stuff, like a freshly tarmacked playground, and an actor coming into your yr 5 class pretending to be a viking.

And if you lived in an area where everyone has less money, or is working multiple jobs, then you'd have a well funded PTA, if you had one at all.

Anyway. I've got all the data now, and I've tidied it up and [its in a spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yKOOl9qIt2_QiHDpDvNpzUGpOI_l5zd7j7fz3auNBqk/edit?gid=171631505#gid=171631505).

There is more I want to do with all of that of course. There is a correlation between a higher proportion of children on Free School Meals and fundraising, but the data is also quite noisy. There is also a clear pattern that schools in more deprived areas are less likely to have registered their PTA as a charity, meaning I have no data at all on their fundraising.
