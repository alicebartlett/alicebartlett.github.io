* For some reason this week my daughter has become very worried about death. From nowhere she asked me "If I get too old, will I die?" followed by a lot of other questions about people dying. No idea where this is coming from. She doesn't seem to know what "dying" is, only that it's bad. I've tried to tell her that it's good, actually. That when great grandad died (he's the only person she knows about to have died because there is a still alive counterpart in "great granny") it was good because he'd had such a long and exciting life.
* We went to Norfolk this week. It was good except my kids got sick again. This time everyone got the shits. Ah well, life with young children.
