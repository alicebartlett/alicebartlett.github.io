* I am tired, so we do it tired.
* Finished work for the year this week, I've actually got a few more must-do tasks for before the end of the year but at the point nobody can assign me any more jobs until 2024!
* The second work Christmas party was great! Lots of food, lots of people dancing and having a jolly time, and _of course_ extremely chaotic cloakroom management. I tried to leave at 10 but had to queue for 40 minutes, and by the time I got to the front of the queue it was 5x as long. This gave everyone something to whinge about the next day, which, in itself, is a gift. It was so bad that the FT reimbursed everyone who missed their last train home. Classy!
* OK look, I want to go watch a movie, so I can't be bothered to scratch around for anything else to say. Bye. Nearly there. X
