* Week 200!
* [Bare naked ladies voice] It's been - 200 weeks since you looked at me, cocked your head to the side and said "she's blogging"
* Hot young female technologists in your area are seeking mentorship.
* May your cultural shifts always be pleasant.
* If you know, you know.
* Had one of those weeks as an "IT PROFESSIONAL" where ur like "wow how does anything on the internet work at all?"
* Chazbot had a vomiting bug at the tail end of this week. He spent a lot of time staring wistfully into the middle distance, his face wan, his hazel eyes shining, before the burping and yarfing soggy bloated raisins and congealed milk all over himself and me. I did get some good cuddles though.
* A good thing about this is that usually he'd have had a seizure by now but the drugs are working and inside his little noggin is calm, like tree lined glade, dew sparkling in the early sunlight, [morning mood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzTQ9fjforY) is playing softly.
* I saw a greater spotted woodpecker in the garden a few times this week. Love that lil guy.
* I fall asleep every night thinking about the gardening.
