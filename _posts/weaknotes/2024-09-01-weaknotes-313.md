* Hiyaa!
* If you have a train-mad four year-old, you gotta book yourself a night at the Holiday Inn in Duxford, which overlooks a train platform. Our room was really close to the platforms and I got a running commentary of the trains coming and going while I drank an alcohol free beer and ate some cheese and biscuits.
* THE GLASS IS STILL IN THE GRAVEL.
