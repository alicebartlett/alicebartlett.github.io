* You could tell things were going OK for me last week because I managed to publish my weeknotes on Saturday morning. "Surely nothing of note will happen in the next 36 hours" I thought.
* Then, in keeping with many [previous](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-124) [weeks](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-332) in January, some bones got broken. This time it was Lachie, coming off his mountain bike, breaking his pelvis and shoulder.
* The injuries can be summed up by the following Dr's quotes: "The structural integrity of the pelvis is intact", "you are young so it should heal fast", "impressive inflammation - that is going to hurt a lot".
* One of our friends is a surgeon at the hospital and generously came over to give us a personalised tour of Lachie's skeleton scans which was very cool and helpful in understanding what was hurting and why.
* The house of cards that was my childcare plans has been annihilated, of course, but the local parent crew has come together to help us out.
* Did you know the A&E in Brighton was built when the city was approximately 60,000 and now it's 140,000.
