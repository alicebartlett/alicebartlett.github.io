* Morning!
* Sorry for posting the wrong link to frogs last week. I've corrected it now. And to save you navigating away, it is also [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/jvgGwNTqFfuUsgq98).
* The frogs have now all disappeared, leaving just a pile of frog spawn.
* The collective noun for frogs is an "Army".
* For her 7th birthday my lovely girl got 10 stick insect eggs. Over the last two weeks four of them have hatched. I've always said those guys are none of my business. One of them has gone to a 7 yr old up the street. Three remain with us. Their names are Lolly, Liam and Eva.
* [Local news for local people] This week the council voted in changes to the school catchment areas for secondary schools in Brighton and Hove. I've been campaigning for the changes since I became aware of them in October. On Thursday I gave a speech (or _deputation_) at the council meeting. I was extremely nervous. The council meeting starts with a man in a tricorn hat carrying a gold mace in.
* What a lot of photons this weekend ay?
* Sunday was the Brighton half marathon. I took the kids down to the seafront to cheer for Lachie. We'd pretended we were going for a swimming lesson and then showed up to surprise him. As we were going into the ice cream shop I bumped into Eliot and his smashing family, and then Anna and her smashing family showed up and we all had ice creams on the beach. Absolutley dreamy.
