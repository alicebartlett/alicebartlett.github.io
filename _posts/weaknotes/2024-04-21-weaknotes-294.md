* Hello friends
* Big week this week. Very tiring. By the middle of it I felt like my brain had been pushed through a sieve. Just a fine goop sloshing about between my ears.
* Next week I'm going to Sofia for work. I haven't been on a plane for 5.5 years, and it's been even longer since I went on a plane without Lachie who is definitely the guy who looks after the passports in the relationship. I am going to try not to annoy the hell out of my colleagues by being a helpless baby, but it does seem like a credible risk.
* Sunday morning... Chaz is in our bed and he's lying on my arm. I'm looking at him, trying, as I often do, to capture every bit of his face so I will remember it perfectly. Gently I boop him on the nose. He opens his eyes, looks at me and says, loudly and clearly "I love cars mum." and then closes his eyes and goes back to sleep.
* I re-did the waist of the archer work-pants and they are absolutely amazing now. So comfy. I've worn them every day.
* After a slow start, my peas have germinated. Last years were really rubbish, partly, I think, because I grew them indoors and they didn't enjoy being transplanted. This year I just chucked them in the ground and left them to fend for themselves.
