* I think pain au chocolates might have started making me day-long sick. Is that possible?
* Made [this ottolenghi](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/12/squash-pumpkin-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi-gnocchi-braised-mash-butternut-coquina-queen) with the first of my three hokkaido squashes. I've never had a hokkaido squash before but I liked it. I'll definitely order more of them for next year.
* Although it's dead easy to save squash seeds, squashes are really promiscuous so the seeds from a Hokkaido could give you any old squash plant. To save ensure they're going to give you more Hokkaidos I would have had to _hand pollinate them and then seal up the flowers so nothing else got in_. 🙅‍♀️
* I have recently learnt that old flowers smell bad (especially sunflowers). This seems obvious in retrospect, but (as a life long unsmeller) I never knew.
* On thursday I got absolutely hammered by accident. When I got home (at midnight after 3 spicy margs) the room was spinning so badly I had to go and sit downstairs and watch TV.
* Peakon season! [redacted]
* My boy has the most lovely curly top.
