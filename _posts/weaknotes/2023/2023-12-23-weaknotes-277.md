* Anybody who has known me for more than 10 years will know I _hate_ loose glitter of between 0.3mm and 3mm. Anything bigger or smaller I am OK with. I know this is weirdly specific. Glitter of this size I am repulsed by. I have managed to relax about this a bit with age, but still. I am uncomfortable around it. One of the reasons I find carnivals and festivals very unappealing is all of the body glitter.
* Anyway, Christmas is glitter season.
* This week I've been off work to look after E who finished school for the year. On Tuesday we held our now annual Christmas party for the local smalls, who all came and enjoyed the gingerbread house we made, and a table set up with a load of craft activities. The extent to which I am a craft-mum is a bit embarrassing. Pretend to be a school child learning phonics? Hell no. Help you make Chtistmas cards for everyone in you class using an adapted block printing technique? for sure.
* May the glitter that your aunt's Chirstmas card is covered with remain strongly adhered to the card.
* May the cyber criminals and state actors leave your website alone during the festive downtime
* May the code-freeze be deep stable
