* Lachie and I have been watching the Beckham doco - or "Bend it* _(*the truth)_ like Beckham" as we call it. It's an enjoyable romp through football business that I wasn't really paying attention to at the time. Also good to get a sequential look at VB's many iconic hair styles.
* E has made up a song to go along to a boogie-woogie rhythm: _"Jo-jo and the wonky weenie"_
* Jo-jo is a man with a very large moustache and the wonky weenie is his pig, who only has one leg.
* I've been at the Financial Times for eight years this week. What a time (eight years) to be alive.
