* Finally got a new photo of my face this week. I've been trying for a while to take a self portrait where I'm not gurning in some weird way but it's just not possible unless there is a person taking the picture. New photo courtesy of E. Pretty good for a seven year old.
* I wasn't working on Friday but the FT had a massive DDoS attack, the biggest we've seen in a while. The DDoS threat has changed so much in the past five years, there are so many more of attempts and they are so much heavier. Happily we were able to serve static versions of our articles while we blocked the attack so there was minimal reader impact. Nice work FT.com Reliability team!
* Gave the kids the first peas from the garden and they loved them!
* I made a [zero waste pouffe](https://thefoldline.com/products/the-modern-sewing-co-zero-waste-pouffe?currency=GBP&variant=49087544361254&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping&stkn=8de12e3d2c10&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21674563360&gbraid=0AAAAAofdMHPWciWSuJRH96myUP4TxgzA8&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_8rBBhCFARIsAJrc9yDFLWdtC0dkEofzSklSlI6OYhpvKA348DWLbCFHiyy_PbKrJO7SNQoaAhF4EALw_wcB) from two pairs of old curtains. It's massive so I've got a lot more sewing to do to create enough waste to fill it. Of course I'll also stuff all of the kids skanky old pants in there as they outgrow them.
