* Wee man loves music, or "usnik" as he still calls it. His best friend's dad is a drummer and we managed to go and see him play in a jazz trio at local market for about 20 minutes this weekend. Chaz and his bestie were allowed on stage to "join in" with the drumming for one song. Certainly a high point of his young life.
* The carpet is in.
* The veg beds at the bottom of the garden have been re-done. The chap that built them agreed to remove "as much of the bindweed as possible". Helpfully, all the bindweed root he couldn't remove he chopped up into tiny 1cm pieces and distributed around the beds. So that's great.
* Ticks and head lice and threadworms! Oh my!
