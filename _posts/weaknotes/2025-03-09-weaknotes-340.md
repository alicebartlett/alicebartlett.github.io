* A lot of mumbling in this week's office job, which is what I call severence when I can't remember the name of it.
* We went to Dorset this weekend for my brother's mother-in-law's 70th. We were invited so E and C could see their small mandarin speaking cousin while she was in the country. My poor sweet E cried half the way home because she loves that toddler so much ðŸ’”.There were some very ugly pigs on the farm, and wittle baby wambs.
* E doesn't call them wittle baby wambs anymore, just me.
* On the way home the kids found one of those ride-on cars at a service station that was giving out free rides. 4 year old equivalent of a lottery win.
