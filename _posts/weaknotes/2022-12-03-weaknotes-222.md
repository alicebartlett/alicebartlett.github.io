* December! Tree's up.
* We got a man out to give our many large trees a tidy-up. Very satisfying to pay an expert to do a job.
* About 6 months ago I started taking a contraceptive pill because I had bad-ish hormonal acne and I thought maybe that would help. It did! and my periods were lighter, and I didn't have period pains anymore. The only thing is it also made me feel dead on the inside. Not sad, just... nothing. So I thought, well feelings are good actually aren't they? and I gave up the pill. And it was great! I have feelings again and also terrible cramps and rubbish skin. Bit annoying that these are apparently my options.
* I own an electric blanket now.
* Haydon Pickering fantastic talk about capitalism (and CSS innovations?) is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZsIhiXJjpY&list=PLZy5V2JKDfX9afwuEl1NolNpvd0yNWc8E&index=2)
