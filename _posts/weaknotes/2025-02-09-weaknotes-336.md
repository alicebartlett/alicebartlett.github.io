* Hello
* Busy week
* On Tuesday I went to an event at LSE called ["Does class inequality still matter? The Great British Class Survey ten years on"](https://www.lse.ac.uk/lse-player?id=6abacd91-eb3c-4bf0-adc9-1d87b1135f9c#:~:text=It%20is%20ten%20years%20since,in%20this%20new%20political%20era.). In her speech Zara Sultana MP used the phrase "just deep that for a second" and I felt very old.
* On Friday morning I went to breakfast with Phil, Dan and Tom, with a short cameo from Matt. I was going to have a little poke around in London after but then I decided to go home and write letters to the Times, Telegraph and Daily Mail about their factually inaccurate coverage of the schools reform, instead.
* I did the PTA quiz on Friday. I don't enjoy organised fun but I did actually have a good time. The high point being knowing the answer to this question:
  * Who won season 1 of the masked singer?
* My silly little foot injury is nearly all recovered. I will have to resume my exercise routine now I guess.
* [This Tiny Desk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91vymvIH0c) from Doejii is very healing.
* C has just heard "uptown funk" by Bruno Mars and I keep hearing him singing "uptown funky pants, uptownfunkypants" to himself.
* It was Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud.
