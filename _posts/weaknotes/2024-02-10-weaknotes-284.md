* Tell u wot, we have Google Duet at work and it is interesting watching how it is changing our company slides decks. I would like to respectfully remind my colleagues to [_illustrate_ not _decorate_](https://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2015/07/one-more-thing.html) their slides. AI has made it even easier to conjure a picture of some nonsense to use in your slides but it is up to you to exercise judgement as to wether it is furthering your message or just making your slides look "whizzy".
* [This thing from the FT by Cory Doctorow about why Facebook, Google etc are all getting worse for us, their users is banging](https://www.ft.com/content/6fb1602d-a08b-4a8c-bac0-047b7d64aba5).
* Last weekend we hosted the Baddlands as there was a cyclocross at a nearby park. The youngest two (3 years each) watched Gladiators in the living room laughing and squealing and running at each other with cushions.
* This week I thought "if I could just get on top of everything, things would be OK." and then I did a big laugh.
