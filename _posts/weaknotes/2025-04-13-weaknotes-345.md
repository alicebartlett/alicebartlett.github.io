* I went to Sofia this week. I thought I'd sussed out the travelling for work thing but on my second night there I went to bed at midnight and woke up and four am and remained awake.
* I also lost a pair of socks that I was knitting somewhere, along with my sock needles.
* Last week's bad mouth thing has now recovered and I can eat food like a normal person without grimmacing.
* This weekend I visited the person who looked after me and my brother when we were 10 months to four years old. She lives in Nuneaton which is half way to Lachie's parents from ours. She's a wonderful person and when I see her the little four year old inside of me is like "yeaaaaaahhhhhhh I love her!!!!". Like, on a bodily level I remember her and want a cuddle.
