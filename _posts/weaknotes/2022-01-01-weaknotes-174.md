* Greetings from the gooch week. I am writing this as I watch "Don't Look Up" which I find deeply unsettling and wish I wasn't watching.
* I still haven't caught Covid, and even though it is seriously doing numbers.
* Christmas was good, it was a relief to be able to spend it with family after last years incredibly depressing last minute cancellation.
* That's it.
