* Some gore this week.
* Last Sunday night as we were walking back from the park so that Lachie and I could go out for a rare dinner-and-a-gig, one of my beloved children decided to climb on the bars that separate the velodrome from the bleachers at Preston Park. They slipped and smashed their face into the concrete.
* There was so much blood I couldn't tell where it was coming from, her mouth just kept filling up and then it would overflow past her gappy lower teeth onto her top, quickly saturating the front from her neck to her waist.
* By the time we got to A&E the bleeding had stopped and she had developed a secret egg bruise under her fringe.
* At A&E they told us "mouth wounds bleed a lot" several times.
* After a few hours were sent home, and amazingly --  a true miracle -- we still made Felice Brothers at Chalk, who were very good.
* On the way back from the gig I took Lachie to the velodrome to see where the accident had happened as I couldn't explain it to him. When we got there all the blood was perfectly covered by woodlice. And that is how I learned that woodlice love human blood. 🧛🏻
* On Monday I spent hours trying to get hold of anyone at the hospital to find out when to return for a chat with the face stitches team as they had said they would call but the never did. Eventually, after lunch, I got a call through to someone and we went in for a quick look but were told the face was gonna be fine.
* Chocolate chip muffin and an apple juice to celebrate.
* People at work keep saying 💁🏻 I am conscious of time 💁🏻 but I always think it sounds more like 🧘 I am conscious of time 🧘
* 🧘 I am conscious of time 🧘 I am limitless 🧘 I live in abundance 🧘 I am conscious of time 🧘
