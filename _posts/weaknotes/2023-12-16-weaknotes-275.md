* Whaddup shrinkflation nation. fr though, the shrinkflation is getting out of control. I never bought Anchor butter anyway because it is indistinguishable from own-brand, but now it's sold in 200g blocks not 250? Nuts.
* Where I really notice it is in kids snacks, every one of them has had 10g skimmed off. I can't stand it.
* I went to the work Christmas party on Thursday (well, part I anyway). I'm still feeling very alive from the dancing. It did take me four hours to get home from London.
* Part II is on Tuesday.
* On Sunday the kids were in their fifth hour of giving it all that so I ran a little hot water in the bath, lit some candles, put on some "spa music" from Spotify and got them both to play "spas" with me for forty minutes. It was great! What a life hack.
