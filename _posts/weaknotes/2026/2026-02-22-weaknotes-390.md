* Week 390.
* E came home from school and told me she had been annoying the boy she sits next to in class by saying "... as only a true poet could say" after everything he said. I love it when the shy guys find their inner troll.
* She got this phrase from a book called "Children's Miscellany - Useless information that's essential to know". It was under a section called something like "How to annoy people" which also included "stare at someone's knees for a long time, and then quietly say 'Cheese knees, hmm, interesting'" which has become a family favourite. 
* What is a Spring Boot. 🌷🥾
* How does the python interpret the egg. Fifteen years since Joe bravely asked the question and we are still no closer to the answers we deserve.
* I went to see Wuthering Heights this week at the cinema with Kirsty and Kyle. Being an artless dummy who knows nothing, I have not read wuthering heights, and so I wasn't burdened with opinions about what it should be like. I thought it was good, if a bit silly, and I could have done without all of the close-ups and loud sounds of slimy things.
* Would absolutely love for it to stop raining now tbqh. No worries if not! thx!
