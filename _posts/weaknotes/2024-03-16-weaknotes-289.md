* I turned 37 this week. Sometimes I look at Lachie and think "can we really be in our late 30s? That seems is impossible because you are as handsome as the day I met you (20 years ago ðŸ™ƒ) and I am still such a slob."
* Wee man has started putting his face right into mine and saying: "I love you like a sausage mummy". Genuinely don't have the words for how watching him grow up feels.
* This week I had a short sharp burst of true-crime podcast levels of personal (NB _not work_) drama. I've written this all out several times but it's just too nuts for the blog. It is so unbelievable that it makes me seem delusional. It is resolved now and I am at peace.
