* More PTA stats digging this week. I am missing data for 24% of the schools because they do not have charitable PTAs. Some of those schools I am very interested in, as they are in the most deprived areas of Brighton and Hove, but predictably nobody is returning my emails so I guess they will remain a mystery.
* IANAS (I Am Not A Statistician) but there does seem to be a statistically significant correlation between "Amount PTA has raised" and "% of children on free school meals", and that number goes in the direction you would expect.
* I will share some charts at some point.
* Wee man did more "settling in" this week. Going well so far.
* Wide eyed with wonder he described something he ate at lunch with apple crumble that wasn't ice cream and it was yellow and it was tasty (Yes, he has discovered custard. We just aren't a custard family, don't look at me like that)
* I started making a pair of sailor style button front jeans. I am going to have to really slowly tap this pattern out.
* THE GLASS IS OUT OF THE GRAVEL. That took 7 weeks. There is still some in a veg bed.
