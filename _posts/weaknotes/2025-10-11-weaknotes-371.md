* Strong desire to take a nap. I think I've eaten too many pastries.
* I've made it to week nine of couch to 5k. I need to continuation strategy - please send your ideas to the usual place.
* A few weeks ago I spent literally five hours (four of them consecutive) trying to put a ribbed neck band into a t-shirt. I finally got it right but the results leave me feeling flat. I know I'll never wear this top so I think it is destined to become a cushion cover. Fine. Annoying.
* I'm into the dog days of my notice period at the FT. Still five weeks to go.
* Some good telly at the moment - Celeb traitors, Educating Yorkshire, Ru Paul UK.
* Lachie is off to Spain next week so I will be solo with the kids. Nap forecast looks poor.
