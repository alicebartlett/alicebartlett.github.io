* I had a coaching session on Wednesday. [Much like the last one](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-95), I cried like the messy baby that I am. At least this time I set the zoom call up better so I wouldn't have to look at my face. See? Growth ðŸŒ±. The coach told me to get more sleep, and so I've been going to bed at 8:30.
* Going to bed at 8:30 means I pretty much put the kids to bed and then go directly to bed myself, so I don't think I'm going to be able to keep it up for long. How will I keep up with all my shows?
* I feel absolutely rancid my dudes.
* I've caught a cold, contracted through my three year old, whose vibrant social life (nursery) is the only way I get any exposure to the hot new pathogens these days.
* Crying aside, I'm enjoying work. Not sure I'm doing it right though?
