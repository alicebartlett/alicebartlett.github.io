* That glass from last week is a right bastard to get out of the gravel. I've managed to clear about 70cmx70cm so far.
* I spent the week in Northumbria with Lachie’s family on a 15 property holiday estate. It has beautiful sunsets, 40 acre woods, meadows, a swimming lake, a swimming pool, tennis court, a spa, a gym, loadsa birds, wild orchids. Boutique centre parcs. Absolutely wonderful.
* A shame the Olympics are happening so I spent a fair bit of time watching people watch sport but I can’t be too bothered by people I love doing the things they love even if I cannot understand it.
* E and her cousin A _do not make good choices together_ but I am just so delighted she has a cousin who can be her best friend that I find it hard to get to cross about it. 
* I did some driving around as part of the holiday and it was pretty good, largely, with the exception of one big cry in the morissons car park.
* One of the things being a driver afforded me was a trip to a [very good yarn shop](https://www.finefettlefibres.uk/) randomly placed in a tiny village.
* One for the things I have realised is that there is one aspect of my personality that is utterly unsuited to knitting and that is the bit where you work out what marriage of yarn and pattern and for a given pattern and yarn how much yardage. I understand all the steps in this calculation but when I am trying to work it through the impulse to be like “who cares! have a guess! YOLO” is extremely intense. Luckily there’s usually someone working in the shop who has a little calculator and a solid grasp on fibre maths.
* On Saturday we stopped over at a Premier Inn to break up the long journey home from Northumbria. The room we were given was 30 degrees C when we got into it, despite it only being 18 degrees outside. When we asked to move rooms they said they were fully booked and we should have gotten an email warning us that the rooms didn't come with air conditioning. In my mind there's quite a big distance between "doesn't come with aircon" - fine, who am I the queen? I don't need air con - and "doesn't come with aircon, is south facing, and the window has a safety feature whereby it only opens 3cm, so it will be about 30 degrees C in your room all night".
* I woke on Sunday morning from a fitful sweaty sleep with a dull headache behind my eyes, feeling like curdled milk.
