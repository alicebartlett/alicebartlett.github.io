* Don't worry. Nothing happened this week. Maybe just you should just skip the notes.
* Well fine, I warned you.
* I was off sick from work for a few days, and I looked after chaz solo as Lachie took E to Scotland.
* Could I get into auricula theatres? I think I could.
* E and C have developed a new prank where they press the doorbell test button, making me think somebody is at the door, and then absolutely piss themselves when I open it and nobody is there.
* I took the kids to the levels, a park where they have these fountains for kids to play in. I thought I was doing pretty well at mumming until E emerged from a bush with a small cut on her hand. I went back there to see if I could work out what she had cut herself on and found both some shards of broken glass and a sizeable human turd.  
* I need it to rain. Please. The garden! All my plants! My peas have given me four pods. A minuscule yield so far but I only grew peas to impress the kids and they love them so - mission accomplished.
* E told me she wants to be an "artventor" when she grows up. An artist who invents things.
* OMFG the succession finale was absolute perfection.
