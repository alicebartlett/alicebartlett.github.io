* Good evening.
* The strategy workshop was well received! It was quite a slog to get it into a format I was happy with, the main issue being that 1 hour is not really long enough for content _and_ activities. Slides are [here](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/strategy-workshop-from-ldx3-director-plus).
* I did see some other bits of LDX3. Charity Majors gave a very joyful keynote about building "normal" companies for "normal**" people, rather than 10x companies for 10x baby geniuses.
* And Meri Williams introduced me to the phrase "Pain is mandatory, suffering is optional" which I have now written on a post-it note and stuck to my monitor.
* I realised too late that I could be spending a very hot Saturday at the gorgeous Saltdean Lido, so we went to the beach instead, which was also glorious. Not too busy and a constant breeze. Next time I will remember that Saltdean Lido exists before everyone else buys the tickets.
