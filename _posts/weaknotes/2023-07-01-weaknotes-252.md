* Ayyyyyyy.
* On Monday I started my new role as [interim] Tech Director for Customer Products (the team I've been a principal engineer in for the last five years).
* Tuesday - Thursday I was at a Staff Plus and then Leading Eng. On Thursday the Staff Plus folks told me the talk I gave did really well on the audience feedback form but I was at that point entirely made of feelings so I just burst into tears.
* Staff Plus was really good, lots of great talks which which I'll be pushing on all of my colleagues once the videos are available. If you're a conference organiser and want to know who you should be picking up, let me know. The conference was very sold out so I know there are more people who would have liked to see these.
* I met some really dreamy people at Staff Plus. I don't know how to keep up with everyone I met now I don't use twitter :(((
* Being at a conference meant I had to spend three nights away from Brighton which I thought I'd sort of enjoy but actually my brain is entirely broken by being a parent and I just missed my family a lot. When I got back everyone acted incredibly pleased to see me and I got spend an hour with the kids doing all the little stuff we do.
* Because putting photos in markdown is a minor hassle, I never bother but! I have some things to share:
  * I finished knitting the [ingrid top](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/ingrid-top-2) and have worn it a lot! I will put it on Ravelry at some point.
  * I also made a mug and a pot a few weeks ago at the pottery cafe in Brighton. I'm so happy with how they came out.
  * Sareh took some photos of me presenting so... here is one of those too.
