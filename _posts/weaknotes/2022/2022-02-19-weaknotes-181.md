* What ho, betches.
* Baby C does this thing where he gets a blanket and sits on the sofa and puts it over his legs like a little old man and just looks so pleased with himself. He's probably nearly smarter than a cat now.
* I went to the office on Wednesday. I find it quite overwhelming these days. Pathetic.
* We're finally free of the covid. Lachie ran into the room and started flossing when he got his second negative test.
