* Right, yes sorry. I went on holiday so these are late.
* The end of term was the usual two weeks of chaos. Arbitrary non-uniform days, class shows (Chaz did an unbelievable rendition of Katy Perry's Roar. Eyes wide, belting it out for all his lungs could manage), sports days, and a final whole school picnic on the field in the sweltering heat.
* This is probably an unpopular take but I find the parent chat "don't they realise I have a job?!? Shall I just quit then?!!!" the most insufferable bit of this period. Every single one of these things is optional. [I skipped the whole school picnic last year](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-308) because it was a Wednesday or something and E was absolutely fine and definitely not scarred for life. This year was the first year I've ever attended a sports day. I think it would also have been fine if I hadn't managed to make it.
* I asked wee man to think of which numbers might be lonely because they don't have lots of times tables pals (ie how to introduce your 5 year old to prime numbers) and he instinctively reeled off the primes between 10 and 20 and then when I asked about any bigger ones he said "ummm.... 29 and 31?". All credit goes to number blocks for creating several absolute jams about the times tables.
