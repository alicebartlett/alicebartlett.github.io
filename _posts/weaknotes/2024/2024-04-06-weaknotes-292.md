* The sticky feet snowman climbing toy E threw at the living room ceiling way back in December has finally fallen down, heralding the official start of Spring. ⛄️➡️🌷
* At the beginning of the week the warm spring air is a feeling that things are possible. What if I paid that after-school club bill that has been outstanding for, er, 12 weeks? What if i really focussed and hot washed all of E's stained school polo shirts to get out all of the weird marks?
* Although we had told C that his big sis was going to Granny's for the week, he was at the dinner table when he actually realised she was really gone. He was halfway through eating his pasta when he announced he was going to the living room to see what E was watching on telly. When we said "no, she's gone to granny's" he bent double let out a primal yell. Testosterone is one hell of a drug.
* A list of names of the toy cars in our house
  * Minima in the Maxima Wagon
  * Superman Stephen King
  * Muscle Tom
  * Chaos Poo
  * Rowan
  * Maxer Stappen
  * Cake Maker
* [Niche knitting content] The problem with petite knits is that they are all modelled by the woman who designs them, and she is this very conventionally attractive (slim! blonde! scandi!) and it's a real hassle to work out if its gonna work for me or if it just looks good on her.
