* Where the hell am I?
* We went to Yorkshire this week with the extended fam.
* Ingleton, home to Europe's largest ðŸŽ©show caveðŸŽ©, also has an antiques warehouse offering a 10% discount on human bones. Despite spending over 2 hours walking round the whole place I still left with nothing.
* On the way back from Yorkshire we went to Thomas Land near nuneaton. It was grim.
* I got home and harvested the squash, maybe somewhat rashly but I was worried they were going to succumb to the powdery mildew that was was killing the rest of the plant. From three plants I got three fruit with the rest rotting on the vine :(
* After Brighton Pride E and I walked into town and picked up all the feathers and lost garland flowers and tinsel. I dutifully washed it all (which was gross), and this weekend we made a piece of Found Pride Art which in my head is called "Be gay, don't drop litter".
* I drove back from my parent's house today. I haven't driven for ages but it was fine. Unexpected side effect of learning to drive but still hating it is that it has ruined being a passenger for me. Before I used to just chill, oblivious to everything happening outside the car but now I ruin it for myself by wondering if I could drive this bit, or if I would do in this situation.
