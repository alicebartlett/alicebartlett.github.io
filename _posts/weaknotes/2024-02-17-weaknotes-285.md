* A complicated, fussy, boring week.
* Lachie took E up to the peak district for half term. The first night he went away, just as I was drifting off to sleep, i heard a strange mechanical noise from the bathroom. Spooked, I bravely got out of bed to investigate and found my electric toothbrush had turned itself on. I now own a new toothbrush.
* Today I pulled out 31 headlice from E's head. I counted them because I told her she could have a smarty for every louse I found. Little parenting tip for you there.
* Another tip -- get the NitNot.
* Another tip -- don't be the parent with the best eyesight unless you also want to be the lice parent. Find yourself a guy with 20:20 vision.
* I know what those of you who don't and have never had a 6 year old are thinking... Are Alice's sprogs especially gross or is this normal? Here's the hard truth: your parent pals and acquaintances are just not telling you about having arse worms for quite understandable reasons.
* I got a thing that makes my desk a standing desk on Wednesday so now I can stand up while working which is great. HOWEVER. It's made my sitting desk quite a bit less ergonomic so... more tedious fussing is required to get somewhere I can both sit and stand. It's not interesting, but it is true.
* When you have nothing left to burn you have to set yourself on fire.
