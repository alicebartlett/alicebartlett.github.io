* The glass is still in the gravel
* These notes are late because I was on holiday during my usual writing time and I couldn't be bothered to get my laptop out and write weaknotes.
* Very nearly all of my clothes are now purchased from either Depop, Vinted or the fancy second hand clothes shop at the top of the hill. Right now I am wearing a Denim Kinsale Smock from depop and some old dungarees. I do still by underwear and socks new.
* The bastard cat's greenhouse antics have disrupted but not completely destroyed my greenhouse tomato game, and we are now into heavenly Skyomish Tomato Season.
