* The birds are singing. Someone, somewhere, in a sub-stack or an instagram story or a weeknote mentioned that after the winter solstice, as the daylight starts to increase, the birds start singing. And now I notice it. After drop-off I walk home trying to only hear the birds and not think about the rest.
* Just listen to the birds singing. Don't think about the limitless pool of sadness inside you. Bottomless, watery, dark, still. No. Listen to the birds. Look at the woodpecker on the bird feeder. Look at the crimson patch on the back of her head. Don't think about the sadness.
* Like last week, I was, am, perhaps a bit depressed? I keep crying all the time? I think it's just January though. It's always just January. In a few weeks I'll see a daffodil and my stomach will flip. The bottomless pool will become a puddle.
* As rough as the first bit of the week was, Friday was great. I went to the beach and looked at the foamy sea. I took some photos of my new September coat. I got a haircut and ate lunch in my favourite restaurant.
* OK enough about my feelings. Bye!
