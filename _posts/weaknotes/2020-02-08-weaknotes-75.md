* Is it spring yet? No. Maybe some spring emojis will cheer me up. I mean this sincerely, spring emojis usually do make me feel good. 🌸🌼💐🌷🐣🐥🐤👒🌱🌦
* What are your favourite spring emojis? Did I miss any? (Ha ha! just kidding. I don't care)
* OK I somewhat care, I just hate that engagement hack bloggers do where they're like "what do you think? - will you be stuffing caviar up your nose as self care? Pop your thoughts in the comments 🐠👇✌️😜"
* This week in broken computers: My laptop keyboard has packed in again. It's not interesting but it is true.
* This week in broken computers: by typing the words 𝔞𝔭𝔭𝔰 𝔰𝔱𝔯𝔞𝔱𝔢𝔤𝔶 into Slack I managed to completely break its spell checking ability so it thought every word was misspelt. Re-starting Slack did not help. Fun bug.
* Did you know that last week a senior bond trader was sacked from Citigroup for stealing a piece of chicken from the work canteen by hiding it under some lettuce? [FT article $$$](https://www.ft.com/content/b7c1952a-467b-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441). Kind of obvious, but people caught stealing even small things in the finance world are often immediately sacked. The article has some other examples of petty and not so petty theft:
> Japan’s Mizuho Bank fired a London banker in 2016 after he was caught stealing a part from a colleague’s bike worth about £5.
> In 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority banned a former BlackRock executive from senior roles in the UK financial sector after he was found to have repeatedly dodged paying the train ticket for his commute to the City.

* I read another good thing in the FT this week from Yuan Yang about [travelling through China](https://www.ft.com/content/75823dbc-4280-11ea-a43a-c4b328d9061c) to visit her family. Lots of nice bits in there about Chinese culture - like the fact that in rural china it's common to address your relatives only by their relation to you - eg "aunt" or "uncle" and if you're not sure what their relation to you precisely is, you can just default to "auntie" or "uncle". Then this bit:

> Fei Xiaotong, an anthropologist of rural China, famously argued that using names was an urban invention, only necessary for those who had not grown up in the same village.

* [This video about tiktok](https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/video/tiktok-movie-criticism-charlie-lyne-phone-video-essay)(via [Chris](https://anti-mega.com/again/that-was-a-week-27-january-2020/), via [Kim](http://www.mildlydiverting.com/)) is good and more interesting than what I mostly hear about TikTok which is boomers saying "It's melting my child's brain and making them stupid". I wonder if I should show those boomers this video? Probably won't.
