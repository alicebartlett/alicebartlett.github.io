* Until I had kids i didn't realise it was possible to read a book aloud while simultaneously thinking about something completely unrelated.
* School started properly this week. Annoyingly the eldest now has to change wrap around care and last term I discovered to my horror the daily after school club for years 3-6 is FULL. This club isn't even _good_ is just a bunch of feckless teenagers in high vis jackets with walkie-talkies. _Anyway_ E is now enrolled in a weird mis-mash of other clubs two of which only run until 4:30 ðŸ¥´
* I asked Chaz what I smell like and he said I smelt "warm and snuggly" and then did this face ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
