* The Mariko Aoki phenomenon is the sudden urge to poo when entering a bookstore. The research on this remains inconclusive, and yet the wikipedia article remains. I don't experience this because I don't go to enough bookstores. _However_ I do have a very real problem with the charity shops on London Road.
* The kids got their school reports this week. Good to have a trained professional confirm what I personally always suspected: Chaz has an "infectious smile" and a "natural flair for numbers". E is very good at reading.
* We went to Bronte country for a wedding this weekend, leaving the kids in Brighton being looked after by their gran. Unfortunately both both kids developed food poisoning shortly after we'd left. #poorgran. The wedding was great fun, apart from when a wasp flew down my dress and stung me and Lachie had to unzip me and get it out. #hero.
* When we got home E was fully recovered and took me on a tour of all the places she had puked around the house.
