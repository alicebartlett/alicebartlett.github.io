* Imagine: there's a tiny parasite. It lives in your gut. It looks no bigger than a fibre from a piece of cloth. It lays its eggs on your bumhole and it wiggles around so your sphincter is unbelievably itchy. The eggs are invisible to the naked eye.
* This is real. You have threadworms. Welcome to hell.
