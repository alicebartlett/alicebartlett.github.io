* One bad thing about the office is how much less good the keyboard is than my _lovely_ mechanical keyboard. I never thought I would be this person. Embarrassing.
* The extent to which I feel absolutely emotionally threadbare from 17 months of pandemic, house move, babies, new job, is difficult for me to explain. I can see it in other people too. Everyone is just living in the limbic system.
* Matt Webb put [this on his blog](https://interconnected.org/home/2021/08/18/frameworks), and I keep thinking about the [Holmes Rahe score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmes_and_Rahe_stress_scale). I'm on about 320.
* Wee man had his third seizure. We had friends over at the time, the first time they had visited us in Brighton, so I was already a bit on edge because I was supposed to be making lunch.
* (One for [Rowan](https://rowanmanning.com/) and [Chee](https://chee.snoot.club/) via [Phil](https://www.gyford.com/)) [This looks good](https://jacobhall.net/2021/08/horton-hears-a-whostyle/).
* The other day I was in a shop and a woman pointed at some [Frida Kahlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo) tat and said "who is that woman? She must be famous or something, I see her everywhere". To me, there is no greater casualty of that kind of 2021 #girlboss #feminism than Frida Kahlo's image. This remarkable woman, reduced to a face and some flowers and used to sell [so](https://www.oliverbonas.com/gift/pocket-frida-kahlo-wisdom-book) [much](https://www.wyldhome.com/products/mermaid-frida-gold?variant=33687892263051&currency=GBP&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_campaign=gs-2018-10-10&utm_source=google&utm_medium=smart_campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjw1JeJBhB9EiwAV612y3HmgdcLICTOX_duyColc1N6KKA8Ee-4ot6qVZ15slMhzTddq6PqHRoCZngQAvD_BwE) [utter](https://bluebelleandco.com/collections/frida-kahlo) [shit](https://www.trouva.com/search/frida%20kahlo). All this junk is so counter to what Frida Kahlo was for. As my friend Kyle pointed out when I promo'ed this rant to him on Saturday, she was literally a communist. It's not like other icons of the basic woman. About ten years ago Audrey Hepburn was kind of all over everything, but I reckon she's partial to a bit of tat from Oliver Bonas, probably loves popping in to paperchase on her lunch break to pick up a Frida Kahlo scented candle.
