title: "Week 350: Bad ideas"

* I compered 50% of Russell's Interesting this week. I had prepared some ad-libs in case anything went wrong with the tech but it was all fine so you won't get to hear my list of talks I want someone to give at Interesting.
* I enjoyed all of the talks (before I had to bail so I wouldn't turn into a pumpkin) but the stand-outs were: Julia on Japanese phrases and Lisa on selective mutism.
* I am a club starter. Cryptic crossword club, Tampon Club, Engineering Book Club.
* Tired: "there are no bad ideas"
* Wired: "there are bad ideas, but we don't punish people for having them".
* I think I lost my Petite Knit cardigan (knitters will know this pain).
