* This week we went to Norfolk
* Beach time was somewhat disrupted by my seeing a [Weever fish](https://www.countryfile.com/wildlife/marine-life/weever-fish-facts) dart out from under Chaz's foot as we were trying to race some boats in a little stream down to the sea. Chaz was fine of course, he had no idea how close to "extreme pain" he had just come.
* Lachie make's out like he hates sand but give that man a spade and ask him to dig a hole.
* Norfolk folk do love their dogs don't they.
* Because I had forgotten to take enough yarn for knitting, I decided to engage in the ancient past time of "reading paper books", which the house we stayed in had many of. One of the books there was "Wild Swans" by Jung Chang, which my parents have in their house. It turns out neither of my parents have actually read it, my Granny gave it to my dad to read and he never did.
* I now know a lot about communist China, which is an unexpected outcome of the holiday.
* Lachie asked Chaz "Are you looking forward to seeing [your sister]?". Without looking up from his chips he said "I look everywhere to see my sister Dad"
* The glass and gravel situation is ongoing, but I think this weekend I might finish it.
