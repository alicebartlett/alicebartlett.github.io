* I finished listening to "Beautiful World, Where Are You" and it was fine. It didn't grab me as Normal People did, I just didn't find the characters very relatable. The characters in Normal People reminded me so much of being a teenager in a british secondary school that it made me feel a bit sick. There is something about the discomfort of wearing a school uniform, being slightly too cold, the polyester blazer, the tie, and then trying to go about the business of being a teenage girl that is captured in Normal People.
* This week was a bit of a mess because baby C is recovering from his cold so was out of nursery and sleeping very poorly, which meant that Lachie and had to split work and childcare and sleep.
