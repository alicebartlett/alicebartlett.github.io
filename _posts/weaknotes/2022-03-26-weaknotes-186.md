* Ay carumba. I spent a lot of this week with a dicky tummy. Just as it cleared up baby C got his monthly dispatch from nursery with a fever.
* Onto the good news: I now own a bed so I no longer have to sleep on a mattress on the floor. The luxury!
* I got to write some more code this week on the new thing we're properly launching on Monday. It's an iOS app, and it's been hard to get into it, especially as I don't want to take up too much of any of the team's who are all very busy working on the critical tasks for launch. However this week I found a bunch of minor bugs which I could fix as a way to understand the app _and_ improve it. Synergy!
* C has an MRI next week which is a massive palava. He's got to have a PCR on monday morning, then isolate until Wednesday, then nil-by-mouth from midnight until the MRI in the morning the next day.
* There is more but I cannot.
