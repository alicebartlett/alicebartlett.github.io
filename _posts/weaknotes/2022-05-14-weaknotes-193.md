* My granny died on Friday after a short illness. She was a warm and soft granny, she always made us a chocolate cake when we went to visit and I can remember the feeling of only being tall enough to wrap my arms around her waist and cuddle into her soft jumper. She used to plan elaborate treasure hunts for us around her house. Before she was my granny, she was an impressive person. She was the president of the socialist society at university in the 1930s. She was a pioneer of geriatric pyschiatry in the 1960s. In the 1980s she helped set up a psych hospital in New Zealand while my grandad (who had just retired) went fishing every day. In the 1990s she established a brand new old age psychiatry service in Suffolk while grandad created a garden full of roses and fox gloves and these massive fruit cages.
* It's finally rained.
