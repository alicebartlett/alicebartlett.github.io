* A very intense week.
* The most peace I felt this week was tracking a shiny red helium number 3 balloon across the sky. It rose over the crest of the hill while I was looking out the window brushing my teeth, so far away I thought it might be a large bird at first. I grabbed my binoculars and tracked it, glinting in the sun, all the way from the west horizon to the east. And that's why we were late to school.
* The kids have invented a new game called "sparkle inspectors". They run up to parked cars and eyeball them really closely to see if they are metallic or not. All metallic cars are celebrated with whoops and yells.
* There is no better feeling than walking along, lost in my own thoughts, and feeling a small hand slip into mine. There you are. Here I am. I love you, you silly goose.
