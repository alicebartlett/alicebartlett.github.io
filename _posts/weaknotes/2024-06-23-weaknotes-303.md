* Hello friends
* I mentioned this in passing 2 weeks ago but, yes, the rumours are true. I've been doing Joe Wicks. Unlike [Tom](https://tomstu.art/weeknotes-233-closed-system), I just do the exercise every other day, regardless of how convenient it is. I feel like a really basic bitch doing HIIT in my conservatory. It annoys me that Joe thinks I'm trying to lose weight even - I'm just trying not to end up a fragile bird woman in my 70s. We've got to put the reps in _now_ so that I can live la dolce vita in 30 years time.
* I drove from my parent's house to GoodWood today, my longest drive since I passed. It's quite an easy set of roads but I still felt absolutely wretched during and after. We watched the prop planes take off and I had a warm scone and tried to calm my limbic system.
* We have a three new pets. They are tadpoles, called Tom, Tom and Chicken Rub. One of the Toms is albino and the reason they now live on our dining room table (yes, I know, gross) is because I really really want to see what an albino frog looks like. I could certainly pretend this is a kid thing but I am by far the most excited about Tom the albino tadpole.
