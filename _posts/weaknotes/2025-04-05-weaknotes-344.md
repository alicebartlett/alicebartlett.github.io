* This doesn't top Tom Stuart's 48 hours with [Noro story](https://tomstu.art/weeknotes-274-pathetic-sips), which I did a dramatic reading to Lachie of because it was so well put, but this week I was also unwell.
* It was an unusual sickness in that my tongue swelled up and my mouth was raw. Gums, under-tongue, inner cheeks and lips all missing a thin layer of skin. I took Monday off, but by Tuesday propped up by Lemsip I was ready to poke at some strategy work.
* On Thursday I had dinner with Sarah and Anna and we talked about the FT and there was _a lot_ of cackling.
* Next week I am going to Bulgaria for work again. It's snowing there right now, which I am furious about >:(
* Today -- Sunday -- I drove from my mum's house to Brighton. That's the furthest I've driven. It was fine. Lachie was there to be reassuring and point out turnings I might be about to miss.
* I've planted peas, broad beans, tomatoes and lettuce.
