* On Friday I got home from a very good lunch with Nat to find there was a piano at the back door. Lachie, and its previous owner, had managed to roll it on a custom made trolley, out of her house and 50 metres down the road to ours. This had taken over an hour, and the final 7 metre journey was up a step, through a door and into our house.
* I was the second pair of hands for the last leg.
* Not five minutes into my new hobby as a piano mover, the piano fell sideways. It made the noise of every single piano key being pressed at once. It was a bad and very loud sound.
* Have you ever seen a hardcore introvert absorbing, internally, the shock of dropping a piano. Watching Lachie was like seeing a man swallow an atom bomb and then just... suppress it.
* Our neighbours, on hearing what sounded like someone dropping a piano on its side, came round to see what was going on and found us, staring silently at a piano on its side.
* One of the neighbours said "well, at least let me help you get it upright". And that was the start of his new hobby of piano mover.
* We now have a piano. Amazingly the only damage done by the piano falling on its side was to our council issued plastic recycling tub which is somewhat crumpled. All people and piano are fine.
