* We walked through Brighton Pavilion Gardens today. I was trying to avoid it because I knew there was a pro-Palestine meeting happening there. Last time E and I intersected with one of those people were shouting "stop killing children!" and I was extremely moved by it but also unprepared for the questions E had.
* But C could hear a din and so we went in. The protest was wrapping up, with lots of people milling around. On about 10 bamboo canes were thousands of white ribbons with the names of [every child](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2024/israel-war-on-gaza-10000-children-killed/) who has been killed in Gaza in the last year, approximately 14,000.
* E asked what they were and could we have one but I was crying too much to answer.
