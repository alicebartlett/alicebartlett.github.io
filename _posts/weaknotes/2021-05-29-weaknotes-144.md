* Following on from last weeks zero to hero meeting moment, this week someone did an accidental Partridge in a meeting, I got the giggles, and two people slacked me to tell me to STOP LAUGHING.
* Isn't it strange that I can't look any of my colleagues in the eye. I wonder what that does to trust...? Maybe nothing.
* The idea of my colleagues seeing me in three dimensions again is a bit stressful. What if I'm disappointing in profile? or have a weird gait?
* The weather has cheered up a bit finally.
* The rocket is growing but the local cats are using the container as a litter tray which has entirely put me off eating it.
* C had a vomiting bug this week which could have been related to him eating bird poo at the park after a lapse in parenting.
