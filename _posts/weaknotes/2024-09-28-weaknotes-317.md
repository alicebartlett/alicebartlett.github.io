* I started the third cycle of the intermediate Joe Wicks HIIT. Last cycle, because they were required, I begrudgingly (got Lachie to buy) a set of weights. However the first session in cycle three tells me I need _a second set_ leading me to wonder... is Joe Wicks in the pocket of big dumbell?
* Chaz's new haircut makes him look like Eleven from stranger things. Two different parents whatsapp'ed me to tell my their kids had described him as "beautiful".
* I asked the wee man if he'd made any new friends in his new class and he said yes, he's made friends with Harry* who he does his "silly business" with. When I inquired about what "silly business" was he shook his derierre and sang "I like to move it! move it!"
* Last week's literal sour grapes really perked up a couple of salads this week. Chris you were right!
