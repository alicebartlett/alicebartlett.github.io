* We went to Norfolk this week for a holiday with my parents.
* I ran out of yarn for my current knitting project so I have finally started knitting a Little Cotton Rabbit. I chose the rabbit because I had the correct size needles with me.
* Dad brought along a board game called [outfoxed](https://www.board-game.co.uk/product/outfoxed/) which is a great little game for a five year old. It's a co-operative so, if, for example, anyone in your family is a massive cry-baby who can't deal with losing to others, this is ideal! We played it loads this week and E was super in to it.
* Between Hunstanton and Old Hunstanton there is the wreck of an old steamboat. Weirdly few people seem to want to go there but it's really cool?
* These are late because I was knitting a jumper for a rabbit.
