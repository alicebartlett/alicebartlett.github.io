* I felt some moments of true contentment this week. Probably just Spring rather than any actual spiritual enlightment.
* It's been a while since I've bragged about how much of a cool girl I am. Really opened my "pick me" chakra and let the need to be liked by men at the expense of other women shine out, but hows this for a catch up: this mother's day Lachie had a team relay race in MK, meaning he would be gone from 8am to 7pm. Of course, being the extremely chill yoghurt babe that I am I was like "sure hun, go get 'em tiger".
* What actually happened on Sunday was I was a bit poorly so Lachie drove instead of getting the race team minibus meaning he was only away 10-6, and I took it extremely easy with the kids.
* E did give me a nice card and some of the good chocolates.
* Remember pre-pandemic when people used to come into work sick and proudly drink lemsip in the office.
