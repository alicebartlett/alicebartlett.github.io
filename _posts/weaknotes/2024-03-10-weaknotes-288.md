* Weaknotes 300 creeps ever closer.
* My brother got me [Wingspan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan) for my birthday. You have to quite like engine building games to slog through learning how to play but now I have grasped the rules I am desperate to play it more.
* This weekend we went to Camber Sands with my parents and brother's family. We stayed in a house on the beach. The whole of one side of the house was massive windows looking out over the sea.
* Wee C is so besotted with his six month old cousin. "He's crying!! We better must comfort him!" (I will feel great sorrow when C stops just using any old pronoun he has to hand (his cousin is a girl) and when he stops saying "we better must [do thing]")
* I went to Rye to Merchant and Mills, who were having a "bobs and bits" sale of seconds and stuff. I got some selvedge denim for Â£4 per metre which is ludicrous.
* On the car on the way home E wanted to watch the iPad. "if you start to be sick, turn it off." I said as I handed it to her, knowing that 6 year olds lack both the self awareness and the self control to do this. Flash forward 60 minutes, I'm holding a shoeless E outside our house as she barfs onto the pavement. Ah well. At least it didn't go in the car and also at least we made it home, if not quite into the house.
* That's all. As you were.
