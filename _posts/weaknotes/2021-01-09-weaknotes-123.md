* Hi gang
* Condolences to all the surprise home schooling crowd.
* Condolences to all my friends across the pond staring bleakly at scenes of the capitol building being occupied by a mob.
* We're still in our support bubble in the Peak District. Originally we had planned to go home this weekend but as 1 in 30 Londoners has covid-19 at the moment we're going to stay where we are until things look a little less spicy down there.
* We got the binnoculars out for the bird table. I saw some long tailed tits, which are a new favourite.
* This week I improved the bit of this website that shows things I've sewn, knitted or embroidered. I've added support for tags, so if you wanted to see [all the tops I've ever sewn](/blog/tags/tops), you may do so. I've also changed the design for [archive page for all my sewing posts](/blog/sewing) to include thumbnails, a task which included creating thumbnails for all the 30 odd blog posts. I also moved a lot of things into subdirectories. I did this all by hand because I had to do it sporadically while my many many children were busy or sleeping or being tended to by relatives.
* Why did I do all that? I don't even know. It was a lot of work, but untaxing, a mediative soothing shuffling things around.
* This week in babies: Chazakhstan now has his third tooth and things are getting very... bitey. The first indicator that he had another tooth on the way was the sound of him grinding them. An absolutely repellant noise.
* [Today in Tabs is back baby!](https://www.todayintabs.com/welcome). Still laughing at Rusty referring to the UK as "'ol knifey".
* I watched a [new three part documentary about Lance Armstrong](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p08qzcqr/lance-part-1) a few weeks ago and I am still thinking about how amazing it was. He's a psychopath! That bit where he says he would counsel his son against doping in the university leagues but if his son was in the NFL that would be a different story. Great telly.
* And the bit where someone is talking about what cyclists of various nationalities are like (French are aloof because they have the best tour, Italians break the rules all the time ([dat](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/903257.stm) [u](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/cycling/3038745.stm) [Mario Cipollini](https://cyclingtips.com/2019/03/the-sins-of-mario-cipollini/)?). Anyway the American cyclists are all _weird_. Because cycling isn't a major sport in the US - so if you're really good at sport then you're playing football or baseball or basketball. Only really strange people choose cycling.
* Stay safe friends.
