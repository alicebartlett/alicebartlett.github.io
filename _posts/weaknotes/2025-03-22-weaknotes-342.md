* I'm sat at the kitchen table planting this year's tomatoes. In walks Chaz: "Maaaaaam, I can... you are... you see... can I? I can see that you're on your own mam... and you--I--you're--I'm you can help--I can help you mum? because you're all alone and you're finding planting seeds hard mum so I'll help you"
* So then we sat and planted some seeds together.
* E is in the treehouse that lachie built. She’s reading a book and drinking squash.
* Squash these days isn’t like the good old days. It’s got fake sugar in it and to me it tastes disgusting. She loves it though and it is a special treat even though it doesn’t have any sugar in it.
* Lachie is mowing the lawn. He both loves and hates mowing the lawn. It feels a bit like self care, the way he does it. The way he feels better once it’s done. They way he hopes for me to say “yes you won’t murder a huge number of frogs or insects if you do it now so go for it.
* [This day in the life writing by a Year Eight student](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carlie-goldsmith-994466294_someone-asked-me-at-the-pub-last-week-what-activity-7308450210408517633-IMmb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAATZSr4BA7jwvFpTHxfIoyK6vzrtXeFErbo) was a punch in the gut.
