* Enjoying the dying breaths of summer 2025.
* I watched a  couple of colleagues present a deck Iâ€™d worked a lot on this week for a new technology strategy. A week ago we had too many ideas and it was overwhelming but today itâ€™s neat and it says what the thing is. Everybody is very grateful for my late nights but this _is_ the job. 
* I canâ€™t believe how bad the search function is on the noun project.
* All of the taps in our house have started dripping. Can this be a water pressure thing? Lachie is watching men on YouTube explain taps. I think heâ€™s enjoying this.
* Lachie who (willingly and enthusiastically) plays schools a lot with our daughter has noted that his teacher has gotten a bit stricter recently, a clue to the step change of year 3.
* One of the local secondary schools has, through a quirk of the admissions process this year, ended up with 45% of year 7s being on free school meals. I wish the parents walking around saying this yeargroup is "unteachable" would HAVE A LITTLE THINK about what they're really saying when they trot out this line. ðŸ˜¤
