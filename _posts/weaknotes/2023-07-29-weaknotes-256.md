* Ever had 10 mostly unrelated meetings in one day? Terrible idea.
* Pro tip for those brave enough to try it: Saying "cheer up tiny tears" to me when I am crying has never not been funny so far.
* There are some seagull legs by the back door.
* I saw a man walking around the suburbs of Brighton wearing a t-shirt that said "ANTI ANTIFA". I actually had to google it because I couldn't believe someone would walk around wearing a t-shirt basically declaring they're a fascist? He was white, completely bald, and wearing unusually ugly sunglasses.
* Ebay now keeps recommending me fashy t-shirts :(((
