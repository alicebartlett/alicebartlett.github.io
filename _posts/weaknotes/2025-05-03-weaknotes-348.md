* When I was little I was *convinced* that in the men's toilets there was a man equivalent of [this bag](https://mellcrest.com/psb-paper-sani-bag?shopping-pmax-024&ppc_keyword=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21661966532&gbraid=0AAAAAqDLAc1SV9QkAG5hzqG0PlMTrrP9Y&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzrzABhD8ARIsANlSWNNFHofLbtUObOmp3V9CWTG-wId0AGYDtcLUuYqEwRcupkkHl2g1tGoaAsB5EALw_wcB). I can still picture it now. A regency man in black and white ready to receive whatever men need to package up in the bogs. This doesn't make sense of course, because those baggies are what us ladies pop our little lady bungs in to encourage us to not flush them down the toilet and break the plumbing.
* I've rigged up my tomatoes in the greenhouse. The foxes are playing havoc with my peas, broad beans and sweet peas.
* One of my most conscious eco pals told me it was good to eat wild venison because they have no natural predators (rip wolves) and they destroy the habitat for loads of other animals (rip plants), so i've ordered some wild venison salami (rip Bambi).
