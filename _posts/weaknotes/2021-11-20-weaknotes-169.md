* Morning
* This week baby C had an EEG and he was very well behaved and happy to have his beautiful noggin all wired up to a machine. The scan was normal - I think all of them will be tbh. A very tall nurse came round and explained about the anti-seizure medicine we have to keep nearby for him. As with all serious situations like that I had to surpress the urge to make a lot of inappropriate jokes.
* I had a good trip to the pub Anna and her dog Pepsi. I don't normally think this about dogs but every time I look at Pepsi, who is a bulgarian something or other rescue cross, I think "this is a really beautiful dog".
* [I've started reading Russell's book](https://profilebooks.com/work/everything-i-know-about-life-i-learned-from-powerpoint/). It's mercifully short and full of interesting facts and sensible ideas for how to "do powerpoint". I feel like the form factor and the title make it seem a bit like it's a joke book you buy for your uncle at Christmas, but those are quite misleading - it's actually much better than that, more joyful, more useful, and more tightly designed. It's also good if you like jokes. Reading it has made me want to do some presentations again.
* I've got a week off next week. Absolutely delirious with excitement for it. The kids are going to still be in nursery so I'll have five days to myself.
