* Hiya!
* Half last this week. We went to beautiful Rainow. I worked and Lachie looked after the kids, ably assisted by Gran and Papa.
* On the drive on the way back we encountered 100ish cars doing a loop of the M25 with their roofs down for charity at 11pm. They were all doing about 55mph and forcing all of the other traffic into the outer two lanes and it was incredibly stressful!
* Chazbot has chicken pox. Last week's vaccine would have been too late for him anyway as the incubation period is 7-14 days. Annoyingly the first appointment, where we turned up and they had not ordered any vaccine, would have protected him. Bummer!
