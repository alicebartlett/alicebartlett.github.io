* Hullo. Returned to work from a holiday this week. Always a bad feeling.
* On Sunday I went for a swim in the sea. Even though I was alone I found myself laughing aloud as the waves pushed me about and I rose and fell with the considerable swell. The water was cool but not cold. Meanwhile E lounged under a sun umbrella reading a book, and Lachie, also a very shade loving creature sat next to her trying to get her to eat a peanut butter pitta pocket. I'm not sure what C was doing exactly. Pottering interspersed with running over the pebbles and giggling for no apparent reason.
* The removal of the glass from the gravel continues. I have probably done about half of it now. That bastard cat. I haven't seen him since.
