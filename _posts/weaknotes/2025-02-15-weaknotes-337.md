* Last week at the PTA quiz a drunk mum got on the mic and sung 99 Luft Balloons like something out of Motherland.
* Last week my 1 year old niece came to visit. She mostly lives in Shanghai so though she can speak a bit most of it is mandarin. E played with her a lot, showing her lots of games and even getting a little "chin chin" [kiss] for her efforts. Everyone said how patient e was with her cousin but I've watched her deal with having a younger brother for 5 years so I wasn't surprised ^_^
* Half term this week. I might need to make a sticker chart for myself.
* I drove to B&Q on Sunday and bought some soil. I still feel so stressed about driving, which I know I need to do more of to get over, but there aren't many reasons to drive when you hate doing it and live in a city.
* I'm trying to get the kids passports. Step one was getting the most miserable looking passport photos in the world for my usually cheerful looking children.
* Might plant some broad beans (under cover) this week.
