* Good evening.
* I drove from my parents house back to my house on Monday. There were moments of the drive where I thought... oh maybe I could see how one day I might not hate this? Still jumped out and made Lachie reverse into the drive tho.
* E came into our room at 3am and got into our bed and said: "Daddy, you are the man I love the most" and now we're all just walking round the house saying "ah - here's the man we love the most!" every time we see him. Get yourself a seven year old, honestly, they're great.
* I found that cardigan I lost!!! I gave it a loving and meditative hand-wash to say sorry for forgetting it in a rucksack.
* I've planted out runner beans, more lettuce, some beetroots and winter squash.
* I deserve a little treat.
