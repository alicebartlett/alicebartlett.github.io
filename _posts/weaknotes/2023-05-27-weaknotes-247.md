* Hi, how are you?
* I've started running again. I keep starting and then stopping because I don't enjoy it but it is the quickest cheapest way to get some form of exercise and we here at alicebartlett.co.uk are cash poor time poor. #outsideisfree.
* Still hate driving.
* The MHL trousers from last week arrived but somebody has taken them up to a 27inch inner leg. [_Humble brag_] that is literally 7 inches too short for me. I should be able to lengthen them by about four inches using the hem allowance. They are incredibly nice other than that though. This is _classic_ vinted. Sure it's cheap but also somehow flawed.
* OK that's all.
