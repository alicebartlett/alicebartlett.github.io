* I like the weather and I will not complain about it.
* Sam, Liz and the gang came down for the weekend so I got to experience Sam's weeknotes in real time, as they happened.
* On Sunday the 8 of us went to the beach. To avoid the most crowded bit we went east. I knew in theory there was a nudist beach between the pier and the marina but in practice I had never seen it. Until today when I looked to my left while tucking into a cheese roll to see a large number of naked bodies lounging on the pebbles.
* The proximity to a lot of - with apologies to any naturists reading - weirdos was largely fine until one of them, who maybe seemed a little drunk, wandered out of the naked area and into the clothed bit looking confused while we all tried to avoid eye contact. In fairness to him, I don't think the limits of the nudist beach are marked, they are totally consensus based.
* The kids (ages 4-9 and clothed) were totally unbothered.
* The latest Hot Money podcast (which is about Wirecard's CEO and Russian spy Jan Marsalek) is an absolute belter.
