* Carrying C the very short walk home from nursery (because even though he is nearly four I cannot say no when he asks for a carry). I kiss his cheek, which is covered in sand for reasons I did not bother to ask about, and say "I love you". He strokes my arm so tenderly, almost absentmindedly, and says "yeah... and I love spotting aeroplanes"
* Finally the weather has picked up. I spent my non-working friday sweating profusely in the greenhouse getting the tomatoes set up.
* I love being part time. Or "fractional" as The Men have now termed it.
* *VERY LOUD VOICE* "I'm auntie skip-rope"
* On Saturday we did the big beach caf√© day: Go to Hove. Go in the sea. Go to the splash park. Go to the play park. Cry because you're so tired and your mum won't let you drive the car home.
* Didn't see the northern lights.
* I got a propagation box from Conservatory Archives. There were about 20 cuttings in there and along with three plants I already had, only one that I absolutely don't want (a creepy begonia)
* Cut my plants in to pieces, this is my last resort. Propagation! No Breathing! Don't give a **** if I cut my arm bleeding!
