* I watched the final series of Pose. It was bad. I watched it all because I like to complete things, but it sucked. Very thin plot, because of the need to sew up all of the character journeys. A lot of super sentimental garbage. And finally - ghosts. I haaaaaaate when ghosts appear in TV shows.
* We've started watching Ted Lasso. I haven't watched anything this good in ages. I love Ted's character so much, but also Coach Beard. Don't spoil this for me, but is it going to turn out that Coach Beard's name isn't actually Mr Beard? Will we ever find out anything more about him than how he exists in the present?
* I'm also watching Sex Education. Although the aesthetics of the show put it somewhere in the past, other things place it here in the present. The attitudes expressed about sex are very current, and in the last episode I saw they referenced Kim Kardashian having a fourth baby via a surrogate, that baby was born in May 2019, putting that episode in late 2018.
* Nat came to visit us in Brighton. We did some painting with my daughter which was very relaxing. They brought me some still warm sourdough from Tom. What an excellent service.
* About six months ago my daughter was asking who was a boy and who was a girl, and I mentioned that some people aren't boys or girls and she was like "cool" but didn't really have any further questions. Then, months later she said "mum, some people aren't boys or girls, some people are NOTHING". I told her that actually those people were "non-binary", which she has remembered as "unbinary". More recently we've been talking about which tv characters she knows might be non-binary. She thinks number 2 from the TV show "number blocks" might be non-binary, which is pretty ironic.
* When we went to Norfolk we visited a couple of beaches that had litter picking arms and plastic holders stuffed with people's old plastic bags. You could take the litter picker and a bag and have a little walk on the beach while tidying up a bit as you go. E loved it, although she found it quite hard to use the grabber with her little hands and feeble grip. This week I bought her a [graptor litter picker](https://www.hhenvironmental.co.uk/product/graptor/) (at first we tried [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07S1BKYJX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), mainly because she wanted a purple litter picker, but it was too hard to use for her hands). Now every morning on the way to nursery we pretend to be litter picking robots

* These weaknotes are late because on Thursday night we hired a campervan and slowly drove to Cardiff where my childhood friend and her family live. The kids both get carsick so we decided to take our time in the hopes that neither of them would throw up or be utterly miserable. It kind of worked lol.
* The campervan was pretty good. I need a new word for when I take some time off work. People say "how was your holiday?" and my contrarian brain immediately says "Ha! A holiday! You call four nights in a campervan with a 1 year old in October a holiday?!" and then I feel like a dick because these people are just doing what you do when someone returns from a planned period away from work.
* Anyway, Lachie accidentally chose a campsite that didn't have toilets (um, so just a field we paid to stay in then...) so I did have to do a poo in some woods this morning which made me feel like Bear Grylls.
* On the way back we stopped for lunch at a place called [The Cowdray Estate](https://www.cowdray.co.uk/). Its a good distance from Brighton for a stop, and the food is good, but, everyone there is _incredibly_ posh. Have you seen the film [Get out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Out). Well... it was like that.
* Every place within 200 miles of Brighton has run out of diesel but once we got a bit further away we were able to buy limited quantities of fuel. WTF guys.
* I have returned home from this trip with mastitis. Handily I have some leftover antibiotics from the last time this happened (ffs) so although I feel like mould right now, I'll give the GP a call in hours and until then I'll chow down on this flucoxacillin.
