* Happy 250 weeks since I decided to start weekly blogging.
* I ran a spell checker over all of my previous posts and fixed myriad typos. Myriad!
* I learnt a lot of facts about platypodes at the department summer rounders game this week.
  * Plural of platypus is platypuses or, strictly, platypodes. That's not a fact about platypuses but language.
  * Platypodes have venemous spurs on their legs
  * They are mammals but they lay eggs
  * They glow under UV light
  * Nobody was good enough at Googling to tell us if they had periods.
* Enough fact shitting!
* I had a dream that I was made head girl. _What could it all mean_.
* I was perusing the FT style-guide the other day. It is full of gems, but today I came across:
> **cynic**
  A cynic is someone who takes a pessimistic view of human motives and actions, who believes the worst about people or the outcome of events; a sceptic is someone who asserts nothing positively and doubts the authenticity of accepted beliefs, who mistrusts people, ideas etc, in general. Let us preserve the distinction.

* LET US PRESERVE THE DISTINCTION.
* It rained!
