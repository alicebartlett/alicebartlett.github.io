* Late on the weaknotes. I just forgot because I've gone onto christmas scheduling.
* At the FT someone has uploaded a set of emoji that is _every emoji_ but with a cowboy hat on. The waving hands has five cowboy hats, one on every finger. This comes from the ðŸ¤  emoji which we call "Yeehaw". Anyway, I'm telling you all this so you understand the following sentence: I finished work for the year and set my slack status to the Christmas tree with a cowboy hat on.
