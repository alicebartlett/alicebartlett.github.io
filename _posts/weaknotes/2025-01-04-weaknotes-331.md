* Sup heaux
* The year-notes are percolating but I'm giving myself until the end of January.
* I did all my seed planning and purchasing for the garden of 2025.
* I accidentally made Lachie go to some _immersive theatre_ this week. Lachie _does not enjoy being immersed in anything at all._ He doesn't even take baths. I didn't know it was immersive theatre until the actor playing a train conductor started a conga line. Anywhoo, if you venture into the seventh circle of hell, which is that bit of Southbank between Westminster Bridge and the Lastminute.com London Eye, you will be able to experience Paddington Bear in _The Paddington Bear Experience_. The kids really enjoyed it, Wee Man especially. He is any performer's dream audience member. Fulling entering into any interactions, laughing, cheering, squealing.
* I finished Gal√°pagos. Really good. Tim was right!
* I finished the September coat finally. It took ages because I kept having to re-do bits. I will do some photos probably?
