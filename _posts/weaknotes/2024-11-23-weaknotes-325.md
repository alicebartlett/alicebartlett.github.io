* I need an [exactitude](https://exactitudes.com/collectie/) on the Ganni beanie athleisure mums. Beachy blonde hair. Sweaty betty. Puffer jacket. Dog with a bit of poodle DNA in it.
* I've joined Bluesky but I have nothing to say 🤷🏻.
* I told Chaz I don't have a sense of smell and he suggested that maybe it just isn't alive yet?
* Went to see Sam and Lizzy this weekend and spent 24h being fed and having my every need tended to while the kids played together with minimal (_minimal_) intervention required. Thanks Baddlands.
