* Half term
* I took the week off as I had some days to use up before the end of March. E and I planned five "chores," five "lessons," and five "adventures," and then I let her plan each day by choosing one of each. Chaz was not involved in the decision-making process, but he was happy to come along for the ride.
* The best day was Monday. There are two statues of Steve Ovett in Brighton. The one in Preston Park was stolen in 2007, and only his foot remains. The second is 6 km away at the seafront and was put in in 2012. On Monday, I printed out a map and marked Steve Ovett's foot, Steve Ovett's full body, and the creperie as a lunch stop, and asked E to draw a route for us to take. When we got to the full Ovett, we walked a bit further along the beach until we reached the very cold crazy golf course, where we played two rounds and then went home.
* On Saturday, I looked out at the pond and it was moving... writhing... shimmering. It was full of frogs. When I went out there, they all disappeared, so I set up my phone to record them. [Here is a very soothing 30-minute video. I love the froggy sounds.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/jvgGwNTqFfuUsgq98)
