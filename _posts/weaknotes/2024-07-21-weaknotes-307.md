* It occurred to me this week that I could put _all_ the annual + mid-year review feedback I've had over 8 years at the FT into chatGPT and do... something?
* Somebody suggested I get it to guess my star sign? Maybe I'll ask it what mercury being in retrograde means while I'm at it.
* I used the term "resources" when I meant people in a meeting and then immediately and very dramatically said "f***ing hell! sorry! _people_", which maybe made it worse actually.
* I spent the weekend as a group of 22 people in a house in Derbyshire, 9 children and 13 adults. These are lachie's school friends who have, unusually, remained mostly intact as a friendship group. I couldn't tell you what their secret is.
* I had a small handful of sungold and some self-seeded rocket this week. Heaven.
