* FEB! FEB! FEB!
* This week I moved my non-working day to look after E and her little mate on Wednesday because of the teacher's strike. I don't really want to get on a soapbox about this because I assume everyone agrees with me, but we should pay teachers more and I'm sad they've had to strike to make this point but I support them in doing so.
* [Matt Sheret](https://matthewsheret.wordpress.com/) has joined the FT for a bit and it's really cosy having him around.
* A granddad at a children's party I was at asked me "what was your job before your children were born?" and I was momentarily very confused until I realised this man had assumed I stopped working when I had children.
