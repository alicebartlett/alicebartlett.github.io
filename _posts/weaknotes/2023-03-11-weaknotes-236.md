* Happy my birthday to you
* My driving instructor told me I'd had "my best lesson yet" this week. I have cleared quite a low bar there.
* Last week there were two dead frogs in the garden, this week I went to the garden and found a further eleven scattered across the lawn. They were in various states of decay. I had to collect them all up in a bucket and then bury them.
* Very specific childhood memory - [We've been taking body talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HKluK3Lvd8)
* Last weekend we took the kids to Goodwood as it is a good stopping point between my parent's house and outs. It was brill! Planes taking off!!! cars doing things!!! Warm scones!
* FAO people who like clothes-making-telly-of-variable-quality: New season of Next In Fashion is on Netflix.
* This week we got emails from nursery about impetigo, chicken pox and threadworms. But in actual fact Chaz caught conjunctivitis.
