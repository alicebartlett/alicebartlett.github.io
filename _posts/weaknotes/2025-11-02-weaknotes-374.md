* This afternoon I went to see Sir Grayson Perry’s show “Are You Good?”. I was hoping for something like his TV stuff on masculinity or being English — both of which I really liked. But it wasn’t that. It was only loosely about the idea of being “good”, and mostly just a list of things Grayson Perry doesn’t like (which turns out to be most things). Except his wife, who he likes a lot.
* I think I was one of the youngest people in the audience, which was a bit surprising, but the show was maybe not meant for the millennial mind.
* There were a lot of sloppy contradictions. For example, he criticised people on the left for not liking all the Union Jack or St George’s flags, but then implied they were hypocrites because there are “flags on the left too”, and launched into a bit about how many versions of the Pride flag there are. As if the issue anyone has is with the actual flag rather than, you know, racism and xenophobia dressed up as national pride.
* Also - the whole thing was done in front of really cringe AI images to illustrate his points.
* I could go on but in summary - "Are you good?" remains unanswered and unfortunately "Is this good?" doesn't appear to have been asked.
* What it reminded me of is how good Bo Burnham is.
