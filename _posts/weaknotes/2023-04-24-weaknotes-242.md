* Parasols for my real friends, real soles for my parasocial friends. That doesn't work but weaknote rules - I think it, I type it.
* There are blue tits in the bird house.
* I've been getting some v good cuddles from the 2.5 year old. He puts his forehead against mine and says "oh my baby oh my baby she's so special!"
* "On your marks, get set, go! Chop-chop lollipop!"
* I am watching Love Is Blind again.
* I am weaving.
* I've finished knitting [this cardigan](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/s34-5-daisy-delight-cardigan) for my daughter and she loves it.
* Now I'm knitting [this top](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/ingrid-top-2).
* The mung beans were fine in that I didn't give myself e. coli, but I wasn't able to enjoy them because of the jeopardy. Ans they were fine, but not worth the risk.
