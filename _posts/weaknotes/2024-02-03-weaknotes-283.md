* And tell me, are the elephants in the room with us right now?
* Went to see Mean Girls at the cinema (the remake) with two school friends (Hi!, Hi!). It was bad. The original was still in there but it was hideously warped. And of course it's a remake of -- not the original movie but -- the musical. Anyway. Don't go and see it.
* Sorry to everyone who didn't get last week's weaknotes and thought I must have been eaten by parasites. I have a makefile that makes the frontmatter for these posts, it has a bug that I can't be bothered to fix.
* The snowdrops are peeping out. Come on fellas.
