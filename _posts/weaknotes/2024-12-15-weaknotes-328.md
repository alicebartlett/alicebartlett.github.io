* Hello lxds.
* Thanks to everyone who got in touch about last weeks weaknotes. My responses are as follows.
  * Sorry yes of course I meant pronunciations of 'oo' in a southern plummy crunchy granola eating middle class accent which is what I have.
  * Ah that is interesting thanks for sharing.
  * Yeah I know!!! what do you think they did with all the old shoes? are they just in a massive pile somewhere... or..
* Work christmas party this week. Very decent. Very fine.
* I did some very big laughs this week.
