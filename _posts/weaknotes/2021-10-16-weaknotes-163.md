* While brushing my teeth this morning I was thinking about school uniforms and I remembered that I was the first girl in my primary school to wear trousers.
* "there's never a bad time to take up litter picking" - Ghandi.
* You know what, a bad time to take up litter picking is during a bin strike. Which is what is happening in Brighton right now.
* Lachie called me and E 'scabs' for going out litter picking.
* Would anyone like this bin bag of crisp packets and bags of dog poo? It doesn't fit in my bin.
* Thanks for your opinions on skirting boards, to all of you who were generous to share.
* [Cute that twitter are testing removing followers](https://mobile.twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1447675111218290694), but we've had this functionality for years. You just block and then immediately unblock someone. It's called the "follower shrug" and I've done it to tens of annoying reply-guys. It's the most satisfying thing to do on Twitter to be honest, you know, since The Discourse ruined everything.
