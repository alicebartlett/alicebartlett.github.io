* Years ago Ben Terrett RDI showed me that he had grouped apps on his phone by icon colour and then arranged them in spectrum order when he swipes between the panes on his home screen. At the time I thought this was Very Ben but a few weeks ago I needed a mindless task at swimming lessons and so I rearranged all my icons. It was a bit of a fiddle but I love it. It feels so right. Ben you were right all along.
* I hope someone does interview Ben for his "habits of a highly successful person", and I hope one of his habits is ordering his iOS icons chromatically.
* Someone interviewed me this week. Not about my habits as a highly successful person. But about what I think about Brighton and Hove council's proposals for the school catchment areas. There is a direct line between me wondering about PTA funding a few weeks ago and now a man (Hi Curtis!) sitting in my kitchen asking me questions about local schools.
* I was feeling a bit wuaghhhhhh about it because, let's just say I don't agree with the majority of my peers on this topic, but then I called my best friend from school and she hyped me up and then told me a very funny story about the air conditioning being broken in the NHS lab she works in, and how it's skewing their results so the "fix" is to put a giant vent in the wall, and when it rains call facilities who tape a bin bag over the outside of it.
* Anyway, public services.
