* "We've never seen it this bad before" - my daughter's teacher commenting on the ongoing head lice epidemic at her school (FML)
* Got 1700l of well rotted horse manure delivered ready for my half term activities.
* I devoured the audio book of Grown Ups by Marian Keyes.
* Nothing is going to make me want to push you out of a window faster than responding for my request for word smithing improvements with whatever shit ChatGPT gave you.
* I had a lovely lunch with Darren on Friday - "Fun with a riff on prim".
