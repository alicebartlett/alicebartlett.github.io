Big little C had a fit on Monday,<br/>
We thought he was done with those but he's not.<br/>
The theme continues; find new ways to scare us.<br/>
The first one,<br/>
The one in a tent in Dorset on the morning of my brother's wedding,<br/>
The one when my friends were visiting,<br/>
The first one that lasted over 5 minutes,<br/>
The first one where we gave him a sedative,<br/>
The one that happened in the dead of night when we were all asleep,<br/>
The time he had two in one day,<br/>
The one that lasted 40 minutes even with all the sedation,<br/>
The one he had at nursery when we weren't there and we had to sprint from the house.<br/>
He's fine again now.<br/>
Doing his scooter practise.<br/>
Yelling at 'eloplanes' in the sky.<br/>
His soft skin, his big hazel eyes, his sandy hair, his chaos brain.
