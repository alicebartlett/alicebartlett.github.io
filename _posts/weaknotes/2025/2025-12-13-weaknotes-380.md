* I am acclimatising to the new job. 😅
* They say ["I am conscious of time"](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-324) here too so there's not too much to miss. 
* This weekend E and I made 14 scrunchies in a "scrunchie factory" that we set up in my office.
* I've got a bit of a sore hamstring from running. It's making other parts of my leg hurt too but really the hamstring is the root cause. I don't know if I should do nothing (ie keep running) orrrrr...
* [Chaz, casually]: "Mum when you watch TV your brain gets smaller and when you read books it gets bigger", "really? who told you that?", [Chaz, authoritatively]:"It was on Sponge bob mum".
* My dad once tried to say "Sponge bob square pants" but he said "Square pants bob" instead. How we laughed.
