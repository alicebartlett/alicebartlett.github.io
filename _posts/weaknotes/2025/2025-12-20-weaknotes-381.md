* Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional.
* Still getting on with the business of being new at work. 
* Finally managed to sew together and hang six Ikea curtains to make a pair of mega curtains to hang in the the front room. They cost me £200 but that is very cheap for mega-curtains let me tell ya'
* I started reading Pirenesi based only on the fact that Denise and Tom and a stranger on TikTok all said it was good. After House of Leaves, I thought I'd never read another book about a massive house, but god had other plans.
