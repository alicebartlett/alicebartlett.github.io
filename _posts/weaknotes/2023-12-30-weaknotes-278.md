* I got my period on Christmas day, a little Christmas pressie from my body to my me. luv u hun xxx
* We spent Christmas in Boston-spa. The journey up was punctuated by people being extremely kind - We stopped for lunch at a cafe that was _maybe_ called "blondes and brews" and _maybe_ in Pontefract and the staff were so over the top kind and happy to help us find a seat, and all of the drinks came with a free party ring. Then later in Pizza Express, E was eyeing up the tree decorations (gingerbread men dressed in Pizza Express outfits) and the man at the desk told her to take one and put it in her pocket. We stayed in two Holiday Inns and both gave the kids presents. Is this just what it's like at Christmas?
* Then after Christmas we went to the Peak District for a few days. Little C walked up to the top of Kerridge (302ft ⬆️) and touched the local landmark _White Nancy_. This is an important rite of passage for any local child so I'm pleased Chaz can tick it off the list.
* Today I fell backwards down the stairs in circumstances that don't cover either me or the other person involved (E) in glory so I won't go into the details. My elbow and pride are both bruised.
