* Thirty weeks of weaknotes!
* Happy mother's day all u mums out there.
* I finished my bird print [Kalle shirt](/blog/bird-shirt) this week. I wore it to work. It got quite a few compliments, many of which came from stylish people. I've already ordered some more fabric for my next one.
* Like everyone else, I have Brexit fatigue. Funny to think that right now nobody has any idea if we'll actually end up leaving the EU or not.
* [Alice vs Nature] We have mice again, or at least, some came to visit and did some poos our living room. (NB not the ideal place for pooing)
* That's it. I could say more about this week but I am choosing bed over writing about things that have happened.
