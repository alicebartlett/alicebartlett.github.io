This week I gave a talk about "Doing Presentations". It was the second time I've given it and I thought I'd better write it up.

Giving a talk like this is very tricky. It has to be given in isolation because any talk given before or after it may fall foul of the advice I'm giving which best case makes me look like a dick but it might also be quite upsetting for the person giving the talk!

Giving a talk about presenting is also awkward because the audience is both hearing my advice and actively experiencing it, putting them in the ideal position to disagree with me.

Anyway, what follows is a write-up. I've included some slides as images. The full deck is (available here)[].

## I learnt most of this at the Government Digital Service
I've given quite a few talks. Most of the advice here comes from personal experience or being around clever people who are good at communicating. People like [Matt Sheret](), [Ella Fitzsimmonds](), [Russell Davies]() and [Giles Turnbull](). These are people I met and worked with at the Government Digital Service.

### This talk will be in three parts
First I'll cover how to give a talk that is actually useful or interesting. Then I'll go into the technics of public speaking, how to do slides, what to wear, what to ask conference organisers in advance. And finally I'll cover how to make your talk _interesting_.

## Think about your audience
This is quite simple really. Who are your audience? What do they want? Why are they here? What do they know already? What do you need to explain? They probably want lunch. They're probably not paying attention.

You should be respectful of people's time. Do this by preparing properly. One hour for every minute you end up presenting is a good rule of thumb.

### You are less interesting than you think you are
Whenever someone runs over their time limit I want to tell them "You are less interesting than you think you are!". Things are rarely more interesting to me than lunch. You can avoid being the person that runs over by practicing properly and being realistic about how much you can cover in a given time slot.

### Help your audience follow your talk
As Russell says: [You have to actively manage audience attention](https://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2015/06/doing-the-hard-work-to-make-it-bearable.html). Slides can help with this. [I've talked through the types of slide I always use here](http://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/how-to-do-ok-at-slides). The essentials are:
* A cover slide for the beginning of your talk. It should have some information about who you are on it, and the title of the talk so people know they're in the right room when you start.
* A slide about who you are. I have a lot of pet peeves around talks. People who stand up and give you **too much** information about who they are is one of them. A little information is useful context for the talk though.
* Your navigation slides. These are the sign-posts that help people understand where they are in your talk and how long is left. If their attention wains then these slides can summarise what they have missed.

## Think about and avoid technical difficulties
All the slide decks I present from have been designed to minimise or eliminate the possibility of something going wrong.

* Use a high contrast design so people can read the text on the slides even if the room is quite bright or the projector is a bit dodgy.
* Use wide margins so if the projector isn't perfectly aligned with the screen no vital information is lost.
* Don't use any subtle colours which will be lost when projected onto the screen
* Test your deck on a projector to check the colours
* Think about the 8% of men who are colourblind and check any charts or graphs that I want to show are going to be legible to anyone with colourblindness. (I use [Color Oracle for this](https://colororacle.org/)
* If there's a risk you're going to have to present from someone else's machine then use a system font in your presentation. Custom fonts can be lovely but I've had to present from an emergency machine before and all my custom fonts weren't which broke all my slide layout. It was awful.
* If you're using video, subtitle it! This can be quite a lot of effort but it is important for two reasons. 1. Any deaf or hard of hearing attendees can still enjoy the video. 2. If the audio fails you have something useful to fall back on and you don't have to awkwardly describe what is happening in the video.
* Do not expect the internet to work in the auditorium. Even events that say they'll have working internet often don't. This means having local copies of any youtube videos or live demos.
* Think about how your outfit is going to work with the mic set up. Mic packs usually clip to a waistband, so if you're wearing a dress you're going to need somewhere else for it to go. Statement necklaces can interfere with clip mics too.

### Work with the conference organisers
When I am preparing for a talk I will send the organisers an email (unless they are real pros and have told me this already!).

It will cover the following:
1. I am going to present from my own computer. It has a USB-C display port. Do you need me to bring an adapter or will you provide one?
2. I will be available for a tech check before the talk
3. [If applicable] My talk includes sound, please provide an audio link from my computer
4. [If applicable] I will need content warnings for the following [flashing images, topics like death or harassment]
5. Please tell me the aspect ratio of your screen

#### A note about content warnings
It is very helpful for attendees if conference organisers mention content warnings just before a break so anyone who wants to skip your talk can, without having to get up and leave. You should also warn people at the beginning of your talk. Conference organisers may need you to hold their hand with this (eg provide some wording for them to use) but it is well worth it.

#### A note about aspect ratios
When I ask what the aspect ratio of the screen it, normally the organisers don't know. And when they get back to me, it's 50/50 if they will have told me the correct one or not.

### Make sure people can read your slides
Do this by making your words nice and big! It's pretty simple really. To do this you will need to keep the number of words per slide quite low, this is good discipline. Limiting yourself in this way forces you to be clear about what you think.

#### PROJECTORS ARE NOT MAGIC
How many times have you been in a talk where someone says:
> Oh dear, that looks different on my screen

or
> Well you can't really read this but...

This is so irritating! Projectors are not unknowable. You can test your deck ahead of time. You should be thinking about the information you're committing to slide and if it's going to be readable. If it isn't then don't put it there.

##Â And finally, make your presentation interesting
If you've successfully done what we talked about in the first 2 sections you're ahead of most people. Let's cover how to make your presentation interesting, and crucially, how to do that without detracting from its clarity.

### Use colour
Colour is a good way to add visual interest to your slides and help vary the energy of the presentation. I usually put my key points on a very bright background so people know they're important to remember.

### Change the energy
Vary the rhythm, vary the pitch, put a lot of words on a slide, vary the visuals, add some sounds, add some video. Your talk needn't be a slog.

Pause.

As Russell says:
> Illustrate, don't decorate.

When thinking of things to add to a presentation, all of them should _serve your point_. You shouldn't add anything just to make your presentation seem "whizzy".

Here, I've illustrated this quote from Russell with a picture of his actual face. Helpful extra information.
I could have googled for a picture of a paint pot and put that there instead, but that's helpful, it's just cruft.

Your pictures should show what you did. They could be a photo of some post-its from a workshop, a picture of a website you built, a photo from user research, a system diagram, a graph of your actual budget.

Back in 2014, one of the regular fixtures at the Government Digital Service all-hands meeting was a section called "Brand Police". Usually someone, probably Russell, would announce a new keynote theme we all had to use or tell us off for using the wrong twitter handle. This sounds like a drag but I loved it because he always introduced the section with an audio bit from KRS

> Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police! Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast!

It was brilliant.

### Be yourself
Giving a presentation is just standing up and talking with slides. You don't need to do anything else. Don't read a blog post aloud.

Don't get hung up on "ums". People (I'm looking at you, _toastmasters_) love to count "ums" but these verbal interjections are a natural part of speech. People get hung up on them because they're easy to measure, but there are much more interesting and meaty things to tackle in giving a good talk.

### Get feedback from peers early
Showing your talk to peers is arguably more scary than delivering it to a proper audience but it is an extremely worthwhile thing to do.

In order to get the most out of my feedback sessions I print all my slides out with space for notes, and then give a copy to everyone attending. This way they can write on the slides as they think of the feedback and I'm not trying to work out what note refers to what later. It also means I can easily take the feedback away with me.

In sessions I also tell people what type of feedback I want. Am I worried about anything in particular? Do I want feedback on slide layout or is that aspect still a mess because I'm going to do tidy up last?
