* My idea for a light-up inflatables company went down like a LED balloon.
* I'm writing this post on my phone in the GitHub UI. The mobile site won't let me add files, so I'm on the desktop version. It's not great on a phone tbh.
* I was looking at some old Instagram photos and I think I'm getting less funny?
