Hello üëã .

I posted this review on my (internal) work blog, with the intention of putting it here too. So here it is, too, modified a bit for a wider audience.

I've read a couple of books lately that I‚Äôve really wanted to share with people so I thought I‚Äôd chat about them here.

Anyway, onto [The Agile Comms Handbook](https://agilecommshandbook.com/). This book is great, really. Very easy to read, no bits where I was like ‚ÄúOK pal, we get it‚Äù which is because I think Giles, the author, has focussed on editing down his words the the minimum he needs to communicate the thing.

It has some powerful ideas I think we, at the FT, should really seriously listen to:

## Three layers of comms

An early idea that Giles introduces is the three layer cake of comms.

On the top is the ‚Äúlure‚Äù this is a tweet length summation of whats going on. It invites people to read more, but allows them to determine if they‚Äôre actually going to find the reading more bit interesting or useful. It should grab people‚Äôs attention because people are busy!

Next on the cake is the ‚Äúcontext‚Äù layer. This might be a blog post, or the body of an email. It tells people enough, but not too much so as to make huge demands on their time.

The final layer is the ‚Äúdetail‚Äù. This is the work we‚Äôre already doing. It‚Äôs tables, architecture diagrams, decision docs. This is what many of us think of as the actual work but we can‚Äôt expect stakeholders to dive into all that work, because it‚Äôs too detailed and they don‚Äôt have the time.

I think anything you want to do a comms on can follow this format. eg - there is a technical incident that we need to email senior stakeholders about. The lure is the email subject. The context is the body of the email. It includes some digestible info about the incident and most importantly any actions the recipients need to take. The detail is linked to from the email, or in an attachment.

In places, we already work like this but I found the way Giles laid this all out very helpful.

## Organisational presentation decks fall into two categories. The kind for presenting in front of and the kind for sharing.

We (in product and tech at the FT) are so bad at confusing these. The presenting kind of deck is for standing in front of (or presenting over video). They should be low on deep detail, and act as a support for the words you‚Äôre saying. Our monthly all team update should be like this!

The other kind is also a valid form of presentation deck, but it‚Äôs the one people read in their own time, it should stand alone as a document or record of a thing. It doesn‚Äôt work as a presentation because there‚Äôs too much detail, too many bullet points, tables of data. If you tried to present this deck you would lose the audience from what you‚Äôre saying in the details.

Giles reckons you if your slides of type 1 are going to be shared after the fact then they should be either rewritten to include all the nuanced things you‚Äôve said alongside them, or should actually just be a blog post.

## Blogging is good and easy

This is an idea I‚Äôm going to take directly to the current projects I'm overseeing at the FT. Listen folks, blogging isn‚Äôt a big deal. Be cool. Confluence has a nice workspace thing, which makes it really easy, and I want the team to share ideas early and often, adhering to the previously explained ‚Äúlure‚Äù, ‚Äúcontext‚Äù, ‚Äúdetail‚Äù cake of comms.

I really hope this way of working will save us the pain of that thing where detail and context is spread across a plethora of google docs that nobody can find.

I also hope this way of working will allow us to share pictures of Kevin Mcloud. This has already happened.

OK, thatssit. This book is good, and short! Really! Who wants to borrow?
