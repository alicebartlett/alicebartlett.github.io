* Hello my babies.
* It's ONE WHOLE YEAR since I went back to work after maternity leave. [Here is what I said about it](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-7).
* Google Hangouts now have live captioning turned if you want it but they asterisk out any swearing?! This seems absurd to me - what are you protecting me from? The knowledge that my colleague described something as "shit"? Not really! Because when I see "s***" I know what they said was "shit"!
* Possibly they have ported auto captioning tech that they use on YouTube, where maybe protecting people from swears is deemed more important.
* I'm on the fence about how offensive swearing is - some people hate it - some people (hello, mum) enjoy dropping a strategic F-bomb. The thing I find really annoying is the asterisk-ing out. If you're going to swear, actually do it?
* I noticed this because Google mis-interpreted something my colleague said as "shit" when they didn't even say that. It was an _imagined_ swear.
* My bike fell on my leg on Tuesday. It landed on my thigh gears first and then scraped down to mid calf. I have some very aesthetic bruises coming through and some nice scrape marks.
* Did you know there isn't a washing machine emoji. I guess that's indicative of how unimportant people think domestic work is. I asked some insiders about this and they showed me [this page of all emoji requests made to the Emoji Subcommittee](https://unicode.org/emoji/emoji-requests.html). It has "washing machine" on it with the status "Added to larger set" which probably means it's being rolled up into a group of emojis (like domestic appliances) to be added.
* My secret source also told me that because of the push to get better skin tone representation (eg two different coloured hands shaking hands 🤝) into emoji, there is not a lot of time for adding other new things. Which is fine. I don't need a washing machine emoji _that badly_ my washing machine is fixed now anyway.
* Did you see the request for a vulva emoji in that list? I think I'll stick with the taco thanks 🌮, especially _especially_ if it means we don't have to have a penis emoji.
* The man who fixed my washing machine, in contrast to last week's man, called me "sweetie", "madam", and "my love" a lot, and asked if the drill out on the table "belonged to my husband".
* Yes the drill belongs to my husband. No you shut up. I could use a drill if I wanted to I just choose not to.
* Today we went to Dulwich Pavilion. I did it mainly for instagram but E actually really enjoyed running around it like a little maniac.
* I've been able to have short conversations with E for a while now. It's lovely.
