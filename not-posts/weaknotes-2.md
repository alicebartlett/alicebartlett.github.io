* Thanks for your email comments about my last weaknotes. When friends are encouraging about my #content it makes it seem like a good thing to be doing and not a weird misunderstanding in which I mistakenly consider myself interesting or worthy of your attention because I am a narccicist.
* Seriously how to I spell check in GitHub's text editor. *As if* I can spell narccicist correctly.
* When I go back to work in 4 weeks time I'm going to be doing a new job. Having taken nearly 10 months away it feels like a great opportunity to drop some not-so-great working habits and pick up some better ones. A bit like your first day back at school. *This is the year* I stop getting in trouble for talking in class.
* The good thing about weaknotes on my blog rather than Instagram stories is I get less of a sneaking suspicion some of you are actually hate-consuming my #content. When it's in the Insta feed you don't get a choice where as this takes a higher level of energy to actually read and hopefully people who are just here for the high octane thrill of seeing someone you don't like do something you don't like won't be forced to see it.
* I've started playing Two Point Hospital (Theme Hospital 2018). It's good, though a bit buggy. As you would expect, the copy is excellent. I laughed aloud at "Catches frisbee 'doggy style'" in particular. Steam is still a mess.
